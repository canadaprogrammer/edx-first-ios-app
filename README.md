# edX First iOS App

## Starting App Development

- Projects VS Playgrounds
  - an Xcode Project allows you to create your finished apps ready for the App Store, whereas the Xcode Playground is more of a testing ground.
  - Projects allow you to store assets for your app development, along with describing the relationships between these assets. These could include things such as source code, libraries, images and frameworks.
  - Playgrounds are an interactive environment within Xcode that allows you to develop and test your Swift code in real-time. By clicking a 'Play' button at any stage of your development, you're able to check how your code is working. However, fully-fledged apps can't be made in Playgrounds.

### Constants and Variables

- Variable: store a value in memory
  - `var <variable_name> = <variable_value>`
- Constant: store a value that won't change, in memory
  - `let <constant_name> = <constant_value>`

### Data Types

- Defining a variable's data type to be stored in a variable happens when carting it
  - `var <variable_name>: <data_type> = <variable_value>`
  - | Type Name | Symbol | Purpose                     | Example |
    | --------- | ------ | --------------------------- | ------- |
    | Interger  | Int    | For whole numbers, integers | 4       |
    | Double    | Double | Numbers with decimal points | 4.6     |
    | Boolean   | Bool   | True or False               | true    |
    | String    | String | Text                        | "Here"  |

### Operators

- Are symbols, singular or combined, that allow you to check, change or combine values
  - | Operator Name  | Symbol | Purpose                                       | Example            |
    | -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
    | Assignment     | =      | Assign a value to a variable                  | Greeting = "Hello" |
    | Addition       | +      | Add the values together                       | 25 + 25 = 50       |
    | Subtraction    | -      | Subtract the values                           | 22 - 11 = 11       |
    | Multiplication | \*     | Multiply the values together                  | 4 \* 7 = 28        |
    | Division       | /      | Divide the values                             | 12 / 4 = 3         |
    | Remainder      | %      | Returns the remainder of dividing the numbers | 12 % 5 = 2         |

## Control Flow and Advanced Variables

### if-else

- ```swift
  if <condition> {
    <code to execute when condition is true>
  } else {
    <code to execute when condition is false>
  }
  ```

### Logical Operators

- | Operator     | Description                                                                                    |
  | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | ==           | The items must be equal to each other                                                          |
  | !=           | The values must not be equal to each other                                                     |
  | >            | The value on the left is greather than the value on the right                                  |
  | >=           | The value in the left is greather than or equal to the value on the right                      |
  | <            | The value on the left is smaller than the value on the right                                   |
  | <=           | The value on the left is smaller than or equal to the value on the right                       |
  | &&           | AND - the condition on the left must be true AND the condition on the right must be true       |
  | &#124;&#124; | OR - the condition on the left must be true OR the condition on the right must be true         |
  | !            | NOT - the opposite of the conditional statement immediately following the operator is returned |

### Switch

- ```swift
  var numberOfSiblings: Int = 2
  switch numberOfSiblings {
  case 0:
    print("only child")
  case 1:
    print("A single sibling")
  case 2:
    print("Two siblings")
  default:
    print("Wow...")

  // result: "Two siblings"
  ```

- Comparison Range

  - `...` or `..<`
    - `case 0..<2: // equal to 0...1`

### Collecgions

#### Array

- An ordered list of data of the same type
  - `var myIntegerList: [Int] = [1,2,3,4]`
- Data in an array is accessed by its index number
  - `print(myIntegerList[0] // returns 1`
- Operations that can be performed upon an array
  - | Operation name               | Description                                             |
    | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | <array_name>.contains(x)     | If x is in the array, returns true else false           |
    | <array_name>.isEmpty         | Returns true if array is empty, otherwise returns false |
    | <array_name>.append(x)       | Appends x to the end of the array                       |
    | <array_name>.insert(x, at:y) | Inserts x into the array at position y                  |
    | <array_name>.remove(at:y)    | Removes the item at position y in the array             |
    | <array_name>.removeLast()    | Removes the last item in the array                      |
    | <array_name>.removeAll()     | Removes everything from the array                       |

#### Dictionary

- An unordered collection, and there is a key and a value
  - `var myDictionary = ["Name": "Jin", "Age": 20]
- Accessing a Key's value is done using if-let

  - ```swift
    if let age = myDictionary["Age"]{
      print(age)
    }
    ```

  - This ensures that the key exists before attempting to do anything with a value

- Changing a Dictionary

  - ```swift
    myDictionary["Age"] = 22 // replace the value if the key exists
    myDictionary.updateValue(39, forKey: "Age") // update
    myDictionary.removeValue(forKey: "Age") // remove
    ```

### for-in

- Allows us to repeat something that is in a sequence or range or collection

  - ```swift
    for num in 10...15{
      print("Number is: \(num)")
    }
    /* return
     * Number is: 10
     * Number is: 11
     * Number is: 12
     * Number is: 13
     * Number is: 14
     * Number is: 15
     */

    var lectures = ["David", "Paul", "Andrew"]
    for lecture in lectures{
      print("Lecturer is: \(lecturer)")
    }
    /* return
     * Lecturer is David
     * Lecturer is Paul
     * Lecturer is Andrew
     */

    var ages = ["David": 20, "Paul": 30, "Andrew": 40]
    for person in ages{
      print(person)
      print(person.key)
    }
    /* return
     * (key: "Andrew", value: 40)
     * Andrew
     * (key: "Paul", value: 30)
     * Paul
     * (key: "David", value: 20)
     * David
     */
    ```

### while

- Keeps looping until a condition is met

  - ```swift
    var points = 5
    var numberOfServes = 1
    while points < 50 && numberOfServes < 3{
      print("Playon, points = \(points)")
      points = points * 2
      numberOfServes = numberOfServes + 1
    }
    /* return
     * Playon, points = 5
     * Playon, points = 10
     */
    ```

### Add the button action

1. Control + click the button on the storyboard and drag the bottom to line 16 (between the last two brackets) on `ViewController.swift`
2. Change the type to "UIButton"
3. Name: textChange
4. Click Connect
5. Control + click the label on the storyboard and drag the bottom to line 11 (under the UIViewController line) on `ViewController.swift`
6. Name: theMessage
7. Click Connect
8. Type action code

   - ```swift
     theMessage.text = "I'm an app developer"
     print("You pressed the button!")
     ```

9. When you click the button, you can see the text appear at the bottom of your screen, in the debug area

## Developer Documentation

- Hover over the UIlabel
- While you've got the Option key down, a question mark appears
- Click the question mark
- The developer documentation has ginve you a brief summary
- Click "Open in Developer Documentation"

## Debugging

- Compiler Errors
  - When the run button is clicked, Xcode takes the code you wrote, combines it with the code in things such as UILabel & creates an executeable file
  - This is called comiling your code
  - The executable file is what runs on the device
  - When the code can't compile, a compiler error occurs
  - These usually occur when the written code has an error in it
- Run time Errors
  - These are what are really referred to as Bugs
  - The code compiles without errors and starts executing
  - While running the code stops or crashes
  - This is where the code did something it wasn't meant to and can't continue on
  - Most of use have experienced these when using software, and they avr frustrating for both users and developers

## Exercise

### Change Label

- ```swift
  //
  //  ViewController.swift
  //  TextChanger
  //
  //  Created by Jungjin Park on 2022-07-30.

      super.viewDidLoad()
      // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    @IBAction func textChange(_ sender: UIButton) {
      counter = counter + 1
      if !iAmADeveloper{
        theMessage.text = "I'm an app developer"
      } else {
        theMessage.text = "I'm going to be an App Developer!"
      }
      iAmADeveloper = !iAmADeveloper

      print("You coded the button press!")
      counterDisplay.text = "Counter: \(counter)"
    }
  }
  ```

### Change background color depending on user input

      case "green":
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.green
      case "yellow":
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellow
      case "orange":
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.orange
      default:
        theMessage.text = "It's an unknown colour entered."
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Temperature Converter

- ```swift
  import UIKit

  class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var celsiusInput: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var fahrenheitInput: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var convertedValue: UILabel!

    var degreesValue: Double? = 100
    var fahrenheitValue: Double? = 0.0

    override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
      // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    @IBAction func celToFah(_ sender: Any) {
      fahrenheitInput.text = ""
      if celsiusInput.text != ""{
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.green
        degreesValue = Double(celsiusInput.text!)

        fahrenheitValue = (degreesValue! * 9/5) + 32
        convertedValue.text = "\(fahrenheitValue!) Fahrenheit"
        print("\(degreesValue!) = \(fahrenheitValue!) in fahrenheit.")
      } else {
        convertedValue.text = "Enter Celsius Value"
      }
    }
    @IBAction func fahToCel(_ sender: Any) {
      celsiusInput.text = ""
      if fahrenheitInput.text != "" {
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellow
        fahrenheitValue = Double(fahrenheitInput.text!)
        degreesValue = (fahrenheitValue! - 32) * 5/9
        convertedValue.text = "\(degreesValue!) Degrees"
        print("\(fahrenheitValue!) = \(degreesValue!) in degrees.")
      } else {
        convertedValue.text = "Enter Fahrenheit Value"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Functions

- Functions are blocks of code that can be run over and over again to do the same things
- They saves us writing out code over and over again, possibly introducing transcription errors
- Functions should do one thing. If we want to do two things, we can write two functions
- A function has two important components
  1. The function definition, where we specify what the function does.
     - A function definition has four components: name, input parameters, output return values and the body
     - The function body is what turns the inputs into the outputs.
     - `func functionName (InputParameters) -> OutputReturnType { // FunctionBody }`
  2. The function call, where we execute the function
     - `functionName()`

### Function Parameters

- They allow us to specify the name, type and quantity of data that will be processed by the function body.
- When we call the function, we can apply the same steps to different data
- There are three board situations to consider:
  - functions with no input parameter
    - definition: `functionName() {}`
    - call: `functionName()`
  - functions with one input parameter
    - definition: `functionName(parameter: type) {}`
    - call: `functionName(parameter: value)`
    - We must specify a name for the parameter that describes its purpose
    - The parameter becomes a variable we can use within the function
    - We also have to specify the data type of the parameter
  - functions with multiple input parameters:
    - definition: `functionName(firstParameter:dataType, secondParameter:dataType) {}`
    - call: `functionName(firstParameter: value, secondParameter: value)`
    - a function should only do one thing; if we have too many (approx. > 6) parameters, it is likely doing to much
- Default Parameter Values
  - When calling the funciton, we don't have to specify all the parameters
  - If we don't we need a default value to use so the function can still run
  - We should have the default parameters at the end of the parameter list
    - This ensures that all calls to the function use the same order for their non-default arguments, and makes it cleear that the same function is being called in each case
  - definitions: `functionName(firstParameter: Int, secondParameter: Int = 10) {}`

### Function Returns

- The value(s) we calculated within the function can be used outside the function
- when calling functions that return, we don't have to have the smae names for the variables storing the returns as within the function
- No reutrns
- One return
  - All that is required is to make the last line of the function start with return, then specify the variable containing the value to return
  - If you return earlier in the function, any lines afterwards will be ignored
  - `return value`
- Multiple returns

  - All we have to do is separate the returns by a comma

- function definition

  - ```swift
    func thisDivides(number: Int) -> (Int, Int) {
      let value1 = number / 2
      let value2 = number / 4
      return (value1, value2)
    }
    ```

- function call

  - ```swift
    var (div_two, div_four) = thisDivides(number: 16)
    print(div_two) // 8
    print(div_four) // 4
    ```

- Exercise: Multiple Returns
  - Define a function called 'calcSumDiff' that for two input parameters 'firstNum' and 'secondNum' will output the sum and the difference of the two numbers.
  - Call your function and store the results in appropriately named variables.
- Then, print the values of these to confirm the function works as intended

  - ```swift
    func calcSumDiff(firstNum: Int, secondNum: Int) -> (Int, Int) {
      let sum = firstNum + secondNum
      let diff = abs(firstNum - secondNum)
      return (sum, diff)
    }

    let result = calcSumDiff(firstNum: 10, secondNum: 12)
    print(result) \\ return (22, 2)
    ```

## Structures

- A Structure contains one or more variables (called properties)

  - ```swift
    struct Person { var anme: string }
    var aPreson = Person(name: "Tim")
    print(aPerson.name)
    // return Tim
    ```

- We can also add methods (functions) to it as well

  - ```swift
    struct Person {
      var name: String
      var age: Int
      var location: String

      func whoAmI() {
        print("Hi, I'm \(name)! I'm \(age) and live in \(location)")
      }
    }

    let aPerson = Person(name: "Jin", age: 20, location: "Victoria")

    print(aPerson.name) // Jin
    aPerson.whoAmI()   // Hi, I'm Jin! I'm 20 and live in Victoria
    ```

- An `initializer` creates an instance of a structure

  - This involves creating an instance of each property
  - We can specify default values for the properties

  - ```swift
    struct WaterMeter {
      var litersUsed: Int = 0
      var customer: Person = Person(name: "Anonymous", age: 20, location: "Canada")
    }

    let theMeter = WaterMeter()

    print(theMeter.litersUsed)  // 0
    print(theMeter.customer.age) // 20
    ```

- When we specify the values when we create an instance, this is called using the `memberwise initializer`
  - `var aWaterMeter = WaterMeter(literUsed: 10)`
- `Custom Initializer`: In more complicated situations, we may wish to write our own initializer functions

  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      var kph: Double   // only kph is stored
      init(kph: Double) { // Basic initializer for kph
        self.kph = kph
      }
      init(mph: Double) { // Advaced logic in initializer for mph
        self.kph = mph * 1.6
      }
    }
    var firstSpeed = CarSpeed(kph: 100)
    var sameSpeed = CarSpeed(mph: 60)
    ```

- `Computed Properties`

  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      var kph: Double
      var nph: Double {
        return kph / 1.6
      }
    }
    ```

- `Mutating Methods`: Added methods to a structure that change the values of the properties

  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      var kph: Int = 0
      mutating func reset() {
        kph = 0
      }
    }
    var myCarSpeed = CarSpeed(kph: 100) // kph is 100
    myCarSpeed.reset()         // kph is 0
    ```

- Type Properties and Methods stay the same for all instances of a structure

  - Add `static` before a property or method

  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      static var legalLimit = 100
    }
    ```

- `self` simply refers to the current instance of a structure (or other object)
- This allows us to interact with the current instance, for example to set or access its properties

- Exercise: Detailed Person

  - Modify the Person structure such that we also store their favourite food and their height. Choose appropriate data types for these properties.
  - Add a second function to the Person structure named 'foodAndHeight' to output these new properties in a human-readable manner.

- Initialise the Structure you've created, and call your new function to confirm the changes work as intended

  - ```swift
    struct Person {
      var name: String;
      var age: Int;
      var location: String;
      var favouriteFood: String;
      var height: Int;

      func whoAmI() {
        print("Hi, I'm \(name)! I'm \(age) and live in \(location).");
      }

      func foodAndHeight() {
        print("My favourite Food is \(favouriteFood), and I'm \(height)cm tall.")
      }
    }
    let bPerson = Person(name: "Jin", age: 20, location: "Canada", favouriteFood: "Galbi", height: 180);
    bPerson.foodAndHeight() // returns My favourite Food is Galbi, and I'm 180cm tall.
    ```

## Classes

- Classes differ from structures as classes can hoave hierarchical relationship
- Classes can have parents (named superclasses) or children (named subclasses)

- Base Classes don't have a parent

  - ```swift
    class Animal {
      var animalName: String
      var numberOfLimbs: Int
      func makeNoise() {
        //
      }
    }
    ```

- Subclassing allows us to extend an existing class by basing it on an existing class (and its methods and properties)

  - ```swift
    class Dog:Animal {
      var breed: String
      override function makeNoise() {
        print("Woof!")
      }
    }
    ```

- If we add more properties to our subclass, we need to override the initializer as it will only initialize the superclasses' properties

  - ```swift
    class Dog:Animal {
      var breed: String
      init(animalName: String, numberOfLimbs: Int, Breed: String) {
        self.breed = breed
        super.init(animalName: animalName, numberOfLimbs: numberOfLimbs)
      }
    }
    ```

- ```swift
  class Animal {
    var name: String
    var numberOfLimbs: Int

    func makeNoise() {
      // Do nothing!
    }
    init(name: String, numberOfLimbs: Int) {
      self.name = name
      self.numberOfLimbs = numberOfLimbs
    }
  }

  class Cat: Animal {
    var breed: String = ""

    override func makeNoise() {
      print("Meow!")
    }

    init(name: String, numberOfLimbs: Int, breed: String) {
      self.breed = breed
      super.init(name: name, numberOfLimbs: numberOfLimbs)
    }
  }

  let myCat = Cat(name: "Whiskers", numberOfLimbs: 4, breed: "Ragdoll")
  print(myCat.name)
  myCat.makeNoise()

  let myAnimal = Animal(name: "Miscellaneous", numberOfLimbs: 0)
  print(myAnimal.name)
  myAnimal.makeNoise()

  print(myCat.breed)
  ```

- Exercise: Another Animal

  - Create a new Subclass of Animal for a Snake. It should store a true or false value regarding whether it is poisonous, a value of its length as well as ensuring its makeNoise function outputs a 'Hiss'.
  - Ensure that you have define the initialiser for the Snake.

- As snakes can be (for this purpose) considered to have zero limbs, pass the value directly into the superclass initialiser

  - ```swift
    class Snake:Animal {
      var poisonous: Bool = false;
      var snakeLength: Double

      override func makeNoise() {
        print("Hiss")
      }
      init(animalName: String, numberOfLimbs: Int = 0, poisonous: Bool, snakeLength: Double) {
        self.poisonous = poisonous
        self.snakeLength = snakeLength
        super.init(animalName: animalName, numberOfLimbs: numberOfLimbs)
      }
    }
    let aSnake = Snake(animalName: "Bell Snake", poisonous: true, snakeLength: 100)
    let bSnake = Snake(animalName: "Bella Snake", numberOfLimbs: 4, poisonous: true, snakeLength: 100.3)

    aSnake.makeNoise()     // Hiss
    print(aSnake.numberOfLimbs) // 0
    print(aSnake.snakeLength)  // 100.0

    bSnake.makeNoise()     // Hiss
    print(bSnake.numberOfLimbs) // 4
    print(bSnake.snakeLength)  // 100.3
    ```

## Introduction to User Interface Development

### Basic Views

- User Interface Components: Apple's UIKit provides us with the components we can use to make our own
- Views: A view is a visual element that makes up our app
  - We can create text, graphics, lines and more with them
  - Most apps contain screens which are made up of many niews, which create what is termed a view hierarchy
  - Views need a Frame (size and position) first
- UIView: The UIView class is UIKit's foundational class
  - This is subclassed to make many components we can use to build our app's interface
- UILabel: A UILabel allows us to display a piece of short text (in our app) to the user
- UIImageView: It allows us to display an image to the user
- UITextView: It allows a user to interact with multiple lines of test within the app
- UIScrollView: It allows users to scroll
  - The benefit of this is to add and explore content larget than the viewport (screen/window)
  - Scrollbars (or indicators as they termed) only appear when the user scrolls
- UIToolbar: It displays a group of buttons at the bottom of the screen (usually)
  - Buttons (or tools) allow users to perform an action
- UINavigationBar: It can be thought of as the 'title bar' - but isn't the only way to make one
  - It has buttons to navigate through the view hierarchy (back, forwards etc)
  - It looks like it sometimes has other buttons (although they are not implemented using a UINavigationBar)
- UITabBar: It looks similar to a UIToolbar, but serves a different yet similar purpose
  - Rather than performing actions, a UITabBar allows the user to select between views
  - It's used in conjunction with a TabBarController
  - It is best used for when the app has multiple workflows i.e. doesn't just run from start to finish like a 'wizard'

#### Playgounds Basic Views

- in Cocoa Touch

  - Xcode > File > New > Playground > iOS > Single View

  - ```swfit
    //: A UIKit based Playground for presenting user interface

    import UIKit
    import PlaygroundSupport

    class MyViewController : UIViewController {
      override func loadView() {
        let view = UIScrollView()
        view.backgroundColor = .white
        view.contentSize = CGSize(width: 375, height: 1000)

        let label = UILabel()
        label.frame = CGRect(x: 50, y: 200, width: 200, height: 20)
        label.text = "Hello World!"
        label.textColor = .black

        view.addSubview(label)

        let textView = UITextView()
        textView.frame = CGRect(x:50, y:240, width: 200, height: 100)
        textView.text = "Tap to edit me - I'm a TextView!"
        textView.textColor = .black

        view.addSubview(textView)

        self.view = view
      }
    }
    // Present the view controller in the Live View window
    PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = MyViewController()
    ```

- in SwiftUI

  - Xcode > File > New > Playground > iOS > Blank

  - ```swift
    import SwiftUI
    import PlaygroundSupport

    struct Name {
      var firstName: String = ""
      var lastName: String = ""
    }

    struct NameRow: View {
      var name: Name
      var body: some View {
        HStack {
          Text(name.firstName)
          Text(name.lastName).bold()
        }
      }
    }

    struct NameView: View {
      var body: some View {
        Group {
          NameRow(name: Name(firstName: "Jin", lastName: "Park")).offset(x:1, y:0)
          NameRow(name: Name(firstName: "Jina", lastName: "Park")).offset(x:0, y:0)
        }
      }
    }

    PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(NameView().padding(150))
    ```

### Basic Controls

- Controls allow us to setup Actions that respond to events (interactions) with the controls
  - An Action is simply a special type of function
- UIButton: It is a control which the user can 'tap'
- UISegmentedCongrol: Think of a UISegmentedControl as a group of buttons where only one can be selected
  - Code is run when the user selects a different button
- UITextField: It is similar to a UITextView or a UILabel
  - In that it allows the user to enter a single line of text - these are properties of those Views
  - Code can also be bound to after each keystroke (use this carefully)
- UISlider: It allows the user to select a continuous value between a lower and upper range
  - As the user drags the slider toggle, code is run, so dragging can trigger an event many times
- UISwitch: They are to controls what Boolean values are to variables
  - Code can run for when the state changes or when it is set to a specific value
- UIDatePicker: It sllows the user to select a date and time
  - Code is executed when date and/or time is changed
- UIViewController: It is not really a control, but a special case view
  - Each screen in an app is usually a scene in Storyboards
  - UIViewControllers manage each view - they contain the Actions and the Storyboards used to generate each screen or scene
  - These are subclassed and overridden to allow us to make our own scenes

#### Playgrounds: Basic Controls

- in SwiftUI

  - Xcode > File > New > Playgrounds > iOS > blank

  - ```swift
    import SwiftUI
    import PlaygroundSupport

    struct AToggle: View {
      @State var isToggled = false
      var offDescription: String
      var onDescription: String
      var body: some View {
        Toggle(isOn: $isToggled) {
          if(isToggled) {
            Text(onDescription)
          } else {
            Text(offDescription)
          }
        }
      }
    }

    struct MainView: View {
      var body: some View {
        VStack {
          Group {
            AToggle(offDescription: "Off 1", onDescription: "On 1")
            AToggle(offDescription: "Off 2", onDescription: "On 2")
          }
          Button(action: {
            print("Tapped")
          }, label: {
            Text("I am a button!")
          })
        }
      }
    }

    PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(MainView().padding(150))
    ```

- in Cocoa Touch

  - ```swift
    import UIKit
    import PlaygroundSupport

    class MyViewController : UIViewController {
      @objc func buttonTapped() {
        print("Tapped the button!")
      }
      @objc func datePickerValueChanged() {
        print("Changed value of the date picker!")
      }
      override func loadView() {
        let view = UIScrollView()
        view.backgroundColor = .white
        view.contentSize = CGSize(width: 375, height: 1000)

        let button = UIButton()
        button.frame = CGRect(x:0, y: 20, width: 100, height: 20)
        button.setTitle("Tap Me", for: .normal)
        button.setTitleColor(.blue, for: .normal)
        button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(buttonTapped), for: .touchDown)

        view.addSubview(button)

        let datePicker = UIDatePicker()
        datePicker.frame = CGRect(x:0, y: 0, width: 375, height: 500)
        datePicker.addTarget(self, action: #selector(datePickerValueChanged), for: .valueChanged)

        view.addSubview(datePicker)
        self.view = view
      }
    }
    // Present the view controller in the Live View window
    PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = MyViewController()
    ```

             4. Check Hidden
             5. You can check it on layout at the bottom of the preview

## Scenes

- A scene is simply 'one thing' we can do in our app that is described by 'one screen'
- Complex apps will require multiple scenes to be able to deliver the required functionality

### Segues

- A `segue` defines how a new ViewController appears over the previous ViewController
- We can also use `segues` to dismiss View Controllers to move back to previous ones, and these are termed `modal segues`.

#### Demo: Creating Modal Segue Project

1. Create project
2. iOS > App > Next
3. Storyboard / Swift > Next
4. Create
5. Click Main.storyboard from the navigation
6. Select the view controller
   - Change the Background color to yellow on the attribute inspector
7. Click library and add a button at the middle and change the title to First
8. Click library and add view controller to next to the view controller
   - Change the Background color to purple on the attribute inspector
9. Click the button and Ctl + drag it to the purple view controller
   - Select "Present Modally"
10. One more for yellow view controller
11. Click Storyboard Segue between View Controllers
    - You can change the attributes from the inspector
12. On ViewController.swift, add below code after override func

    - ```swift
      @IBAction func unwindToOrange(unwindSegue: UIStoryboardSegue) {}
      ```

13. Click library and add a button to orange view and change the title to Dismiss
    - Click the button and Ctl + drag it to exit at the top of the view controller
    - Select unwindToOrangeWithUnwindSegue

### Triggers

- Segues can be triggered either using the Interface Builder or programmatically using Swift code
  - We generally connect the trigger to a control such as a button, so the segue is triggered when the user taps the button

### Unwinding

- Dismissing a segue is termed `unwinding` it
  - We can't really do this using Interface Builder
  - We do this programmatically by creating an `IBAction` function that takes a `UIStoryboardSegue` parameter
  - We then need to connect the IBAction to a control, which we will do in the exercise

### Navigation Controllers

- Using a Navigation Controller we can push a new ViewController on top of the stack with a push transition

#### Demo: Navigation Controller

1. Cont'd Segue demo
2. On Main.storyboard, Click the first View Controller
3. On the menu bar
   1. Editor > Embed In > Navigation Controller
4. Click Segue between first and second view controller
5. On the Attribute Inspector, change the Kind to "Show (e.g. Push)"
   1. You can see "< Back" on the second view controller
6. Same thing again to the seque between second and third
7. Change Navigation title style
   1. Click title on the Navigation Controller
   2. On the Attribute Inspector, change the style, title,
8. Click Library and add Bar Button Item to the right side of the navigation section on third view controller
9. On the Attribute Inspector, change System Item to Custom and Title to Dismiss
   1. Click the button and Ctl + drag it to exit at the top of the view controller
   2. Select unwindToOrangeWithUnwindSegue

### Navigation Bars and Items

- This can be customized visually in Interface Builder, keeping in mind the Human Interface guidelines
- The Navigation Bar is implemented ad a `UINavigationBar`
- To customize what the bar says, we need to modify the Navigation Item within our View Controller
- We can customize the style by modifying the attributes of the Navigation Bar

### Passing Information

- Generally, we will need to pass information between View Controllers
  - This is despite changing View Controllers to a different `task`, as it is still part of a larger workflow
- We override the `prepare` function to setup data for transfer during a segue
- The `prepare` function is how we programmatically define a segue

#### Demo: Passing Data between ViewControllers

1. Cont'd Navigation Controller Demo
2. Click Libaray and add Text Field to below the button on the first view controller
3. Click the text field and drag it to above override func viewDidLoad() on ViewController.swift

   1. Name: textField
   2. Click Connect
   3. It will create `@IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!`
   4. Type a code below the code

      - ```swift
        override function prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
          segue.destination.navigationItem.title = textField.text
        }
        ```

4. Click "Start the active scheme"

## Tab Bar Controllers

- Tab Bar Controllers are commonly seen in many apps to separate different workflows within an App
- To add a Tab Bar Controller in Interface Builder, we drag it onto the Canvas from the Object library
- To add a tab, we drag it from the Object library into our TabBarController
- Each of these tabs is termed a Tab Bar Item
- Tab Bar Item has a Label and an Image
  - We can use a bunch of built-in icons or supply our own
- We can customize the look and feel further using Swift code

## ViewController Event Handling

- Life Cycle States
  - A View Controller can be in one of the following states:
    - View not loaded
    - View appearing
    - View appeared
    - View disappearing
    - View disappeared
- View Did Load
  - The most common function is viewDidLoad, which runs when the View Controller is loaded
  - Generally this function is used to programmatically initialize the View Controller
    - Set up values, connect to resources, etc.
- Overriding

  - One think to be aware of is that as we are overloading each of these functions, you must call the superclass initialiser within them when you do so

  - ```swift
    override func viewWillAppear(_animated: Bool) {
      super.viewWillAppear(animated)
      // you write your code here
    }
    ```

- Function with `will` run before the event, whereas functions with 'did' run afterwards

## Navigation Hierarchy

### Hierarchical Navigation

- A user makes one choice per screen/scene until they reach their destination scene
  - If they change destination, they have to start from the beginning, retracing their steps back to the start
  - Used in apps such as Settings
- Generally implemented with Navigation Controllers

### Flat Navigation

- Users can switch between different categories or 'workflows'
- Ganerally implemented with a Tab Bar Controller

### Content-Driven Navigation

- This is a different and more free-flow type of navigation
- Users can move in a non-linear fashion between elements of the App
  - The most common example would be games

### Workflows

- It is best to consider what the User will be doing in the App before building it
  - This is to be able to best design the navigation hierarchy
  - Consider the features and how they will be built as View Controllers, as well as the movement between them

### Design Guidelines

- Apple recommend the following things to consider when designing a Navigation Hierarchy
  - Design a structure to make it fast and easy to get to content
  - Use standard navigation controls, such as a Navigation Bar when implementing a Hierarchical Navigation
  - Use a Tab Bar when implementing multiple categories (modes, workflows) of content or functionality
  - Use the correct style (modal va push) where appropriate

## Protocols

- "defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality."
- Swift defines many protocols
- Types that conform to a protocol must implement all the requirements of protocol

### CustomStringConvertible Protocol

- A protocol to display how objects are printed to the console
- A textual representation of the values contained in an object's variables

- A Class without CustomStringConvertible Protocol

  - ```swift
    import UIKit

    class Book {
      var title: String
      var author: String
      var isbn: Int

      init(title: String, author: String, isbn: Int) {
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn
      }
    }
    // Let's create a book
    var book = Book(title: "Adventures", author: "John Doe", isbn: 100)
    // Let's display the book
    print("book is \(book)")  // book is __lldb_expr_7.Book
    ```

- A Class implementing CustomStringConvertible Protocol

  - ```swift
    import UIKit

    class Book: CustomStringConvertible {
      ...

      var descritpion: String {
        return "Book title: \(title), autho: \(author), ISBN: \(isbn)"
      }
    }
    // Let's create a book
    ...
    // Let's display the book
    print(book) // Book title: Adventures, author: John Doe, ISBN: 100
    ```

### Equatable Protocol

- The Equatable protocol allows objects to be compared for equality

  - ```swift
    import UIKit

    class Book: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable {
        ...

        static func == (bookOne: Book, bookTwo: Book) -> Bool {
            let booksAreTheSame = bookOne.title == bookTwo.title &&
                bookOne.author == bookTwo.author &&
                bookOne.isbn == bookTwo.isbn
            return booksAreTheSame
        }
    }
    // Create two books
    var firstBook = Book(title: "Adventures", author: "John Doe", isbn: 100)
    var secondBook = Book(title: "Future Adventures", author: "John Doe", isbn: 101)
    var thirdBook = Book(title: "Future Adventures", author: "John Doe", isbn: 101)
    print(firstBook) // Book title: Adventures, author: John Doe, ISBN: 100
    print(secondBook) // Book title: Future Adventures, author: John Doe, ISBN: 101
    // Let's check if the books are the same with Equatable implemented
    if firstBook == secondBook {
      print("You have that book already")
    } else {
      print("Buy the book")
    }
    // Buy the book
    if thirdBook == secondBook {
      print("You have that book already")
    } else {
      print("Buy the book")
    }
    // You have that book already
    ```

## Delegation

- Is a design pattern where a class or structure delegates responsibility to another
- As with humans, there are 2 parties involved
  - The one who delegates
  - The one who it was delegated to

## An App's Life Cycle

- | The State of the App | Description                                              |
  | :------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  |     Not running      | The app isn't running                                    |
  |       Inactive       | It is in the foreground but not receiving anything       |
  |        Active        | It is in the foreground, running & receiving events etc  |
  |      Background      | The app is running code code but isn't in the foreground |

- <img src="./apps_life.png" alt="App\'s Life" width="300" />

- The AppDelegate.swift file contains six important functions for your App, and these functions map to the lifecycle
  1. Did finish launching
  2. Will resign active
  3. Did enter background
  4. Will enter foreground
  5. Did become active
  6. Will terminate

## The App Delegate

- As of iOS13, `Scenes` allow multiple instances (windows)
- Each `Scene` is an independent instance that can be in foreground or background - as the above image
- The App Delegate, within AppDelegate.swift, manages the creation of the App as well as creating and destroying Scenes

### AppDelegate Methods

1. application(didFinishLaunchingWithOptions)
   - Run when the App has been opened, setup for all scenes
2. application(configurationForConnecting) -> UISceneConfiguration
   - Run when a new Scene is created
3. application(didDiscardSceneSessions)
   - Run after a Scene is closed

## The Scene Delegate

- Manages the lifecycle of each individual Scene
- Need to manage the transitions of each scene between each state, foreground and background
- Located within our (new) SceneDelegate.swift file

### SceneDelegate Methods

1. scene(willConnectTo, options)
   - When the Scene is first created
2. sceneWillEnterForeground()
   - when the Scene enters the foreground. Run before the Scene is Active but is in the foreground
3. sceneDidBecomeActive()
   - Run after the Scene is active in the foreground
4. sceneWillResignActive()
   - When the Scene becomes inactive on the way to the background
5. sceneDidEnterBackground()
   - When the Scene moves into the background from the foreground
6. sceneDidDisconnect()
   - When the Scene is finished/closed/terminated

### Playgrounds: An App's life cycle

1. Create a new project
2. Add `print("We are: [function_name]")` to each function on AppDelegate.swift, SceneDelegate.swift, and ViewController.swift
3. Click `Show the debug area` on the bottom of the editor
4. Launch the application
5. You can see the progress on the debug area
   1. didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
   2. configurationForConnecting
   3. willConnectTo
   4. viewDidLoad()
   5. sceneWillEnterForeground
   6. sceneDidBecomeActive
6. On the simulator, swipe up the app from the bottom
   1. On the debug area, you can see `sceneWillResignActive`
7. On the simulator, click the app
   1. On the debug area, `sceneDidBecomeActive`
8. On the simulator, swipe up the app from the bottom and click background
   1. On the debug area
      1. `sceneWilResignActive`
      2. `sceneDidEnterBackground`
9. On the simulator, click the app
   1. On the debug area
      1. `sceneWillEnterForeground`
      2. `sceneDidBecomeActive`
10. On the simulator, swipe up the app and then swipe up the app to terminate
    1. On the debug area
       1. `sceneWillResignActive`
       2. `sceneDidDisconnect`
       3. `didDiscardSceneSessions`

## Model View Controller

- It is an architectureal design pattern
- Separates
  - the Model of the data
  - the View the user sees
  - the Control of what happens and where things go
- Every object belongs to either the Model, the View or the Controller

### A Model

- Defines the structure of the data: group the data for something specific into a Model
- Often relates to other Model objects
- Knows nothing about the View
- Models are often classes or structures
- The arrays/dictionaries created to store the colours in our App were also Models

### A View

- The objects seen by the user, the User Interface: buttons, labels etc.
- Can draw itself on screen
- Can respond to user input
- Displays the data from the Model to the user
- Allows the user to interact with the App's data

### A Controller

- Manages the App
- Configures the views for yours
- Controls the View and Modal to ensure correct data is displayed
- Is a message carrier between the Views and the Model(s)
- View, Model and Helper Controllers

### Projects in Xcode

- An Xcode project can have a lot of files
  - Views
  - Storyboards
  - Structures
  - Classes
  - Protocols
  - Controllers
- Organizing Projects
  - File names must be descriptive
  - Individual files for your types (classes, structures)
  - Possible file structure
    - View controllers
    - Views
    - Model
    - Other

## Scroll Views

- Used when what needs to be displayed in larger than the screen the App is running on
- The class is the UIScrollView
- Only scrolls if content's size is grater than the frame's width or height
- Scroll Views can be implemented using Interface Builder's Auto Layout feature
- Constraints can be added to the scroll view edges securing them to the view controller's view
- This can ensure the scroll view and view controller's view are the same size
- This means no matter was device it is displayed on the scroll view and view controller's view are the same size

### UIScrollView Class

- It requires 2 pieces of information
  - Position & size of the scroll view. They stored in the frame property
  - The size of the content to be displayed. It stored in the contentSize property
  - These properties can be managed through AutoLayout and Interface Builder

### Family of Scroll Views

- Within the `UIKit`, `UIScrollView` has many child classes
- Two such classes are `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`
- All of `UIScrollView`'s functionality exists within `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` - the power of inheritance

                 super.viewDidLoad()
                 let notificationCenter = NotificationCenter.default
                 notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(adjustForKeyboard), name: UIResponder keyboardWillHideNotification, object: nil)
                 notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(adjustForKeyboard), name: UIResponder keyboardWillChangeFrameNotification, object: nil)
             }
             @objc func adjustForKeyboard(notification: Notification) {
                 guard let keyboardValue = notification.userInfo?[UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as? NSValue else { return }
                 let keyboardScreenEndFrame = keyboardValue.cgRectValue
                 let keyboardViewEndFrame = view.convert(keyboardScreenEndFrame, from: view.window)

                 if notification.name == UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification {
                     scrollView.contentInset = .zero
                 } else {
                     scrollView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 0, left: 0, bottom: keyboardViewEndFrame.height - view.safeAreaInsets bottom, right: 0)
                 }
                 scrollView.scrollIndicatorInsets = scrollView.contentInset
             }
         }
         ```

## Table Views

- Probably the most widely used view in iOS Apps
- It is a `UITableView` class
- Large amounts of data can be simply and beautifully displayed to the user
- Users can navigate through hierarchically structured data
- An indexed list of items can be presented
- Detailed information and controls can be displayed in visually distinct groupings
- A selectable list of options can be presented
- To facilitate large amounts a scrolling, single-column list is provided
- The table view can have a header & footer
- Each row can be divided into sections or groups
- Each section can have
  - A header above the first item
  - A footer below the last item

### Table View Controllers

- Adding a Table View to a project can be done in 2 ways
  - Add a table view instance directly to a view controller's
  - Add a table view controller to the storyboard
- The table view controller is a view controller subclass responsible to manage a single table view instance
- Table View controller is the data source and delegate of the table view
- These already contain a large amount of functionality
- The benefits of Table View Controllers means most iOS developers use them

### Table View Style

- Plain
  - The default style
  - Rows separated into labeled sections
  - Optional index along the right edge of the table
  - Sections follow on immediately, no spacing, an unbroken list is created
- Grouped
  - Visually distinct groups or sections with in spacing between is possible when displaying rows
  - Index along the edge is not possible

### Table View Editing

- Table Views can be set to editing mode
- Users can then
  - Insert new cells
  - Delete cells
  - Or, Reorder cells

### Table View Cells

- Every table row is represented with a table view cell: `UITableViewCell`
- Cells are reusable views and can display: `Text`, `Images`, or Any other `UIView`
- Each cell has an optional accessory view
- Cell content size shrinks in editing mode, allowing space for the editing and reorder controls
- Three properties are defined for cell content:
  - `textLabel`, a `UILabel` for the title
  - `detailTextLabel`, a `UILabel` for the subtitle
  - `imageView`, a `UIImageView` for an image

### Index Path

- Points to a specific row in a specific section of a Table View
- The row ans section properties facilitate access
- They are zero based like arrays

### Arrays

- Table views are fantastic in displaying similar data and are often undergirded with a collection of model objects
- An array is the usual choice although others are possible
- An Array has the count property, facilitating knowledge of how many pieces of data it has
- The table view's number of rows can be calculated from this

### Dequeuing a Cell

- In displaying large data amounts, a table view could have large numbers of cells
- To prevent this Table Views only load the visible cells plus a small number above and below what is visible
- Cells that leave the visible field can be reused on those things about to enter the visual field
- This is dequeuing - it uses the `reuseIdentifier` along with the `dequeueReusableCell()` method

          let tableViewEditingMode = tableView.isEditing
          tableView.setEditing(!tableViewEditingMode, animated: true)
      }

      ...

      override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, moveRowAt fromIndexPath: IndexPath, to: IndexPath) {
          let movedCountry = countries.remove(at: fromIndexPath.row)
          countries.insert(movedCountry, at: to.row)
          tableView.reloadData()
      }
      ```

## More Complex Table Views

- Create a custom table view cell for different reasons:
  - to display more text, more buttons etc.
  - customize object locations within cells
- Custom View Creation: Steps Involved
  - Select the Cell
  - In the Attributes inspector set Style to Custom
  - Using Interface Builder tools, we can customize it
- Content Hugging
  - The flag needs to fit snugly into the content area
  - Change the horizontal field priority in Content Hugging Priority
  - From 251 to 252
  - Priorities the placement by the Auto Layout Engine
- New Cell SubClass
  - A custom table view class is needed
  - We can create outlets for configuring the cell
  - Ensure it is a Custom class of FlagTableViewCell
- Editing Table Views
  - In editing mode the table view calls the delegate method: `tableView(_: editingStyleForRowAt: )`
  - There are 3 options: `.none`, `.delete`, `.insert`
- Delegate Methods
  - Delegate methods are called in order in edit mode
    1. `tableView(_: canEditRowAt: )`
    2. `tableView(_: editingStyleRowAt: )`
    3. User does something here...
    4. `tableView(_: commit: forRowAt: )`
- Adding to the Flags
  - Add a + button to the navigation bar
  - Use a new view controller to add details
  - the same view controller for edits and additions can be used
  - A static Table View is used in this situation
- Static Table Views
  - Use a table view controller
  - Do NOT implement the data source protocol
  - Populate the table view using `viewDidLoad()`
- Add a Navigation Controller
- To the Navigation Controller
- Develop the Table View
  - Setting the content to Static Cells
  - Change the labels to reflect the content
- Saving and Canceling
  - Add Navigation Bar items
  - Almost all Apps have these buttons: Save and Cancel
  - Save only when something changed

## Saving and Persistent Data

- To save data the Codable protocol is implemented
- An object that conforms to Codable can save & load data
- To conform to Codable protocol requires two methods to be implemented
- Most built in Swift types already conform

### Encoder object and the Decoder

- An Encoder object is used to encode the data for saving
- A Decoder object is used to decode the data from its saved state

  - ```swift
      // create a book
      var book = Book(title: "Adventures", author: "John Doe", isbn: 100)

      // Encode the book and print the encoded book
      let propertyListEncoder = PropertyListEncoder()
      if let encodedBook = try? propertyListEncoder.encode(book) {
        print(encodedBook)

        // Decode the encoded book and decoded book
        let propertyListDecoder = PropertyListDecoder()
        if let decodedBook = try? propertyListDecoder.decode(Book.self, from: encodedBook) {
          print(decodedBook)
        }
      }
    ```

    - The encode method is a throwing method, hence we use `try?` with it
    - It now will return optional Data instead of errors
    - Print gives us the number of bytes in it

    - The decode method is also a throwing method, hence we use `try?` with it
    - It returns optional data instead of errors
    - Printing gives us the book instance

### SandBoxing

- iOS uses sandboxing to protect data from rogue apps
- Sandboxing
  - App1 can not access any of App2's resources
  - Certain cases with user permission access is permitted

### Documents Folder

- An app has certain folders to save data to
- Documents folder, the location your app saves & modifies its information
- The path to the Documents folder changes
- The path is like a URL to the folder
- A FileManager class function gives access to the Documents folder

- ```swift
  // Set up FileManager to save the data to file

  let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!

  // documentsDirectory holds the URL to that folder

  let archiveURL = documentsDirectory
      .appendingPathComponent("book_library")
      .appendingPathComponent("plist")

  // Encode the book, write the encoded book to file

  let propertyListEncoder = PropertyListEncoder()
  let encodedBook = try? propertyListEncoder(book)
  try? encodedBook?.write(to: archiveURL, options: .noFileProtection)

  // Set up to retrieve the data from the file

  let propertyListDecoder = PropertyListDecoder()
  if let retrievedBookData = try? Data(contentsOf: archiveURL),
      let decodedBook = try? propertyListDecoder.decode(Book.self, from: retrievedBookData) {
      print(decodedBook)
  }
  ```

  - The actual path is in the sidebar
  - Using `try?` to take the encodedObject (encodedBook) and write it to the archiveURL

### Demo: Saving and Persisting Data

- ```swift
  import UIKit
  import Foundation

  class Book: CustomStringConvertible, Codable {
      var title: String
      var author: String
      var isbn: Int

      init(title: String, author: String, isbn: Int) {
          self.title = title
          self.author = author
          self.isbn = isbn
      }

      var description: String {
          return "Book title: \(title), author: \(author), ISBN: \(isbn)"
      }
  }
  // Create a book

  var book = Book(title: "Tristan's Adventures", author: "D.A. McMeekin", isbn: 100)
  print(book)

  // Save Data

  let propertyListEncoder = PropertyListEncoder()
  if let encodedBook = try? propertyListEncoder.encode(book) {
      print(encodedBook)

      let propertyListDecoder = PropertyListDecoder()
      if let decodedBook = try? propertyListDecoder.decode(Book.self, from: encodedBook) {
          print(decodedBook)
      }
  }

  // Persistent Data

  let documentsDirectory = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first!

  let archiveURL = documentsDirectory.appendingPathComponent("book_library.plist")

  let propertyListEncoder_1 = PropertyListEncoder()

  let encodedBook_1 = try?propertyListEncoder.encode(book)

  try? encodedBook_1?.write(to: archiveURL, options: .noFileProtection)

  let propertyListDecoder_1 = PropertyListDecoder()

  if let retrievedBookData = try? Data(contentsOf: archiveURL), let decodedBook_1 = try? propertyListDecoder_1.decode(Book.self, from: retrievedBookData) {
      print(decodedBook_1)
  }
  ```

## System Controllers in Apps & User Input

### System View Controllers

- Provide a way to
  - Display alerts
  - Share content
  - Send messages
  - Access photo library, camera etc
- Different Controllers
  - `UIActivityController`: share with other apps
  - `SFSafariViewController`: display things from the web
  - `UIAlertController`: present information & options
  - `UIImagePickerViewController`: camera or photolibrary
  - `MFMailComposeViewController`: send email

### UIActivityViewController

- Tapping Share button creates a UIActivityViewController instance
- Grab the image from the UIImageView
- UIActivityViewController's initializer takes a parameter activityItems
- activityItems is an array of type Any
- Add the image to the array
- Present the activity controller
- The code:

  - ```swift
      @IBAction func shareButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        guard let image = imageView.image else {return}
        let activityController = UIActivityViewController(activityItem: [image], applicationActivities: nil)
        activityController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = sender
        present(activityController, animated: true, completion: nil)
      }
    ```

    - An image variable is created from UIImageView
    - image is added to the activity controller's array parameter
    - We won't use applicationActivities
    - popoverPresentationController from where the view controller is presented to the user

### SFSafariViewController

- Opens a Safari web browser within our App
- SafariServices framework must be imported
- Three things are required:
  - Create a URL from a string, a web address
  - Create an instance of SFSafariViewController with the URL
  - Present the view to the user
- The code:

  - ```swift
      @IBAction func safariButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        if let url = URL(string: "https://www.curtin.edu.au") {
          let safariViewController = SFSafariViewController(url: url)
          present(safariViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
        }
      }
    ```

    - A URL is created
    - An instance of SFSafariViewController is created
    - The view controller is presented to the user

### UIAlertController

- Used to allow users to interact with your App
- Get user's attention, present options, get choice
- Things that need to be done:
  - Specify the Alert title
  - Create the message
  - Decide how to present it to the user:
    - .alert at centre of screen
    - .actionSheet at bottom of screen
- The code

  - ```swift
      @IBAction func photoButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Choose Image Source", message: nil, preferredStyle: .alert)
        let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil)
        alertController.addAction(cancelAction)
        alertController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = sender
        present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
      }
    ```

    - A UIAlertController is created with a title & style is set to .alert
    - The UIAlertAction is crated to respond to the user's choice, with title, style & handler
    - It is added adn the UIAlertController is presented

### UIImagePickerController

- UIImagePickerController provides access to the camera & the photo library
- Two protocols must be adopted:
  - UIImagePickerControllerDelegate
  - UINavigationControllerDelegate
- Create an instance of UIImagePickerController
- Set the view controller as the delegate
- The user is presented with choices
- The UIAlertController will need to handle responses
- The camera and/or photo library should only be presented if they are available
- UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(\_:) is used for this, returning a Bool
- The code(1)

  - ```swift
      @IBAction func photoButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let imagePicker = UIImagePickerController()
        imagePicker.delegate = self

        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Choose Source", message: nil, preferredStyle: .actionSheet)
        let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil)
        alertController.addAction(cancelAction)
      }
    ```

    - Create the UIImagePickerController instance
    - Set the delegate to self
    - Create & configure the UIAlertControllers as we did earlier

- The code(2)

  - ```swift
      if UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(.camera) {
        let cameraAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Camera", style: .default, handler: {
          action in
          imagePicker.sourceType = .camera
          self.present(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
        })
        alertController.addAction(cameraAction)
      }
      if UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(.photoLibrary) {
        let photoLibraryAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Photo library", style: .default, handler: {
          action in
          imagePicker.sourceType = .photoLibrary
          self.present(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
        })
        alertController.addAction(photoLibraryAction)
      }
      present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    ```

- Changing the image

  - imagePickerController(\_: didFinishPickingMeediaWithInfo:) method is used

  - ```swift
      func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey : Any]) {
        guard let selectedImage = info[.originalImage] as? UIImage else {return}
        imageView.image = selectedImage
        dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
      }
    ```

- Info.plist
  - The App won't behave as we think, not quite yet
  - The project Info.plist needs to be adjusted giving accesss to the photo library and camera

### MFMailComposeViewController

- Allows email to be sent from within your App
- The MessageUI framwork must be iported
- The mailComposeDelegate is responsible to dismiss the mail compose view controller
- The ViewController class must adopt the protocol: MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate
- Check if mail services are available
  - canSendMail()
- Create an instance of MFMailComposeViewController
- Set the .mailComposeDelegate to self
- Configure different aspects of the mail message
- Present and then dismiss the view controller
- The code

  - ```swift
      @IBAction func emailButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        guard !MFMailComposeViewController.canSendMail() else {
          print("Can not send mail")
          return
        }
        let mailComposer = MFMailComposeViewController()
        mailComposer.mailComoseDelegate = self
        mailComposer.setToRecipients(["Taylor@swift.com"])
        mailComposer.setSubject("Testing for you Taylor Swift")
        mailComposer.setMessageBody("Hello, Taylor!", isHTML: false)
        present(mailComposer, animated: true, completion: nil)
      }
    ```

    - Checked if mail can be sent
    - Created the MFMailComposeViewController instance
    - Set mailComposeDelegate to self
    - Presented it to the user

- MailComposeController

  - Use a delegate method to dismiss the view controller

    - ```swift
        func mailConposeController(_ controller: MFMailComposeViewController, didFinishWith result: MFMailComposeResult, error: Error?) {
          dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
        }
      ```

    2. Do samething for the other buttons
    3. Add `print("shareButtonTapped") into the buttons on ViewController.swift

#### Implementing the Share and Safari Buttons

- Add below code into shareButtonTapped on ViewController.swift

  - ```swift
      guard let image = imageView.image else {return}
      let activityController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [image], applicationActivities: nil)
      activityController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = sender
      present(activityController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    ```

- Add below code into safariButtonTapped

  - ```swift
      if let url = URL(string: "https://www.curtin.edu.au") {
          let safariViewController = SFSafariViewController (url: url)
          present(safariViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
      }
    ```

#### Commencing the Implementation of the Camera Button

- Add below code into cameraButtonTapped

  - ```swift
      let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Choose Image Source", message: nil, preferredStyle:  actionSheet)

   4. Click `+` button next to the `Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description`
   5. Type `Privacy - Camera Usage Description`
   6. Type `Using the camera` as the value
2. It asks the user for permission to use the camera or to access the photo library
3. Add below code to above `emailButtonTapped` for applying the selected image on the imageView

   - ```swift
      func imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [UIImagePickerController.InfoKey: Any]) {
          if let selectedImage = info[UIImagePickerController.InfoKey.originalImage] as? UIImage {
              imageView.image = selectedImage
              dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
          }
      }
     ```

      if !MFMailComposeViewController.canSendMail() {
          print("Cna not send mail")
          return
      }
      let mailComposer = MFMailComposeViewController()
      mailComposer.mailComposeDelegate = self // to use mailComposeDelegate
      mailComposer.setToRecipients(["Taylor@swift.com"])
      mailComposer.setSubject("Testing for you Taylor Swift")
      mailComposer.setMessageBody("Hello, Taylor!", isHTML: false)
      present(mailComposer, animated: true, completion: nil)

          dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
      }
     ```

### Input Screens

- User Input
  - Not all Apps are for entertainment, some are for preductivity
  - Apps are used for business, research, data collection
  - These Apps can require complex user input
  - Multiple control types and views need to be used
  - More common than you might think
- Data Model
  - What data are you collecting from the user?
  - What type fo data is it?
  - What will you do with that data?
  - How will you use the data?
  - Plan the data model accordingly
- Collecting the Data
  - What views are best for your data collection?
  - Prevent user input errors
  - Dates: what kind of data format?
  - Numbers: integers, doubles?
  - Addresses, City names, Airport codes etc
- Collecting String Input
- Collecting Date Input
- Collecting Integer Input
- Sliding Scale Input
- Collecting Binary Input

## Construct an AR App

### Intro to Augmented Reality (AR)

- What is Augmented Reality?
  - Augmented Reality (AR) refers to a display that is composed of reality that also has computer-generated content superimposed on top of it
    - While any sense can be augmented, the most common is the 'visual' sense
    - Cenerally, the reality is a camera feed of the user's surroundings from the point of view of the device
    - The content superimposed can be in two or three dimensions, photographic or animated
- Swift and AR Apps
  - The ARKit framework provides a platform with the tools necessary for developing AR apps
    - ARKit operates in a visual 3D space, such that animated 3D objects can move in the 3D space of reality
    - ARKit removes all the 'nuts and bolts' of making an AR app, however every 3D object and interaction between reality and the object must still be specified by the developer

### AR Project Template

- The AR App Templated
  - In Xcode, our existing Apps have been built from a 'Single View App' (SV) template
    - This allows us to use components such as Buttons, TextFields, Sliders and so forth
  - Xcode provides us with an 'Augmented Reality App' template that allows us to use AR-focused components
- Content Technology
  - Apple has a bunch of frameworks that can be used to develop an AR app
    - <img src="https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/icons/spritekit/spritekit-128x128_2x.png" alt="SpriteKit" with="30" height="30"/> SpriteKit is focused in 2D-space
    - <img src="https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/icons/metal/metal-96x96_2x.png" alt="Metal" with="30" height="30"/> Metal is a powerful (and complex) toolkit for 3D-space
    - <img src="https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/icons/scenekit/scenekit-128x128_2x.png" alt="SceneKit" with="30" height="30"/> SceneKit is also used for 3D-space and it is what we'll be using in this course
- AR Project Template
  - Similar to when we create a SV App, creating an 'AR App' also generates a bunch of files in Xcode as part of the initial project
    - A .scnassets catalogue is created which catalogues .scn files used to describe each 3D model as well as .png files used for textures (look and feel)
    - Main.storyboard is still there, however instead of having View Controllers composed of UIViews, they are compsed of ARSCNViews
- AR Project Template
  - The Info.plist file contains a few different properties compared to SV Apps:
    - There is a minimum requirement for ARKit within Device Capabilities
    - There is a Camera Usage Description to specify the text for when the App asks the User for permission to use the camera (which is sort of necessary)

### Using AR Frameworks

- Using AR Frameworks
  - When writing Swift code in our View Controllers, we will need to use a couple of extra frameworks
    - ARKit and SceneKit - which we just discussed - must be imported to be used. We do still need UIKit as well
- ARSCNView
  - The sceneView outlet in ViewController.swift is connected to the ARSCNView in Interface Builder
    - We can override its viewDidLoad to set up the AR scene, for example by loading in 3D models
    - When ARSCNView is loaded, a session property of type ARSession is initialised. This ARSession takes care of the 'magic' of AR, such as image processing and tracking
  - We have to set up the ARSession in our viewWillAppear function, but we can give it default values
  - We can aslo call pause() in viewWillDisappear
    - This will pause the AR processing
    - Whe the View Controller isn't seen, it is a waste to do all that processing
- Delegation
  - By default in the AR template, the View Controller will be declared as an ARSCNViewDelegate
    - This enables the ARSCNView to communicate with the View Controller, such that we can override functions
    - These functions correspond with events (as in the case of most of the built-in classes that we use)
- Scene Positioning
  - Whe you run your App, if you move the phone around, you'll see the ART stays the same
    - With respect to reality - it will stay in the same place of the room!
    - This is based on where the ART is specified in 3D space
    - We will see in the exercises that the three axes correspond to (0,0,0) and the ART is offset from that

### AR Components in SceneKit

- 3D Objects in SceneKit
  - Recall back to when we looked at objects in UIKit. Each object required a size and a position
    - In this case, it was only in two dimensions (2D)
    - Positioning items was with respect to the parent
  - SceneKit functions similarly; except in 3D
    - Keep in mind, we won't be putting in things like TableViews, Checkboxes, Labels etc.
    - We use SCNNode's to represent things (lik ART) instead
- Creating a Scene
  - Again constrasting to building apps with traditional UIKit components, we can build scenes programmatically or visually with ARKit
    - A scene being one ViewController; one thing we use the camera to interact with
    - A single scene, as before, can be a combination of both programmatic and visual elements
- Adding Nodes
  - Nodes are one type of Objects we have with ARKit
    - We can also add geometric shapes, lighting and cameras (representing the point of view) to our Scene
  - We will examine the different types of Objects in action during our exercise
    - Right now, we'll go over a few of them in detail
    - Firstly - geometric shapes that inherit from SCNGeometry
- Geometry Types
  - Box: a rectangular prism
    - Programmatically is the SCNBox class, can specify width, height, length and chamfer when constructed
  - Plane: a two-dimensional flat surface
    - Programmatically is the SCNPlane class, can specify width and height when constructed
    - Must be viewed at an angle, and needs to be rotated (using euler in the Inspector) if the plane is to be along a different combination of axes to default
  - Cylinder:
    - Programmatically is a SCNCylinder, specify radius and height on construction
  - Sphere:
    - Programmatically is a SCNSphere, specify only radius on construction
  - Cone:
    - Prgramatically is a SCNCone, specify topRadius, bottomRadius and height
- Programmatic Properties: Geometry
  - We will explore setting properties of the SCNGeometries first hand in the exercise
    - firstMateral?.diffuse.contents: to set the colour (using UIColor)
    - firstMaterial?.isDoubleSided: to colour both sides of a plane (well, both sides of any geometry)
- Programmatic Properties: Node
  - We will explore setting properties of the SCNNode first hand in the exercise
    - node.geometry: to assign / create a relationship betwen a SCNGeometry to a SCNNode
    - node.eulerAngles: to rotate a SCNNode
    - node.position: to move a SCNNode
  - There is a SCNVector3 obejct to representation 3D sets of reotation angles or positions
- Lighting Elements
  - Light sources are used to make the surfaces of objets appear more realistic
  - ARKit provides a range of different types of lighting
    - Just like going down to the hardware stroe
    - The differences are generally regarding where the light comes from and where it is going to
    - We'll look in depth in the Exercises

### Surface Detection and Interaction

- Feature Points
  - So far, we've just built scenes we don't really interact with
    - Well, we can move the camera around, but the objects don't do anything. They don't respond to the movement
  - Traditionally, it was very difficult for the developer to make Augmented Reality apps
    - Tracking motion and orientation, determining features (elements of reality such as objects and floors)
  - There features are represented as Feature Points by ARKit, which can be visualised using a DebugOption
    - We can use these to detect planes (like tables or floors)
    - However, we need to ensure there is sufficient lighting and texture (as well as not too much movement) for ARKit to be able to work on detecting these
    - Too much movement of the camera will also cause issues
- Plane Detection
  - By adjusting our ARSession (the ARWorldTracking-Configuration) properties, we can enable plane detection. For example, to detect horizontal planes
    - configuration.planeDetection = [.horizontal]
  - We can override the renderer() function to capture the event when a plane is detected
    - This is as our ViewController is a delegate to the SceneView. We then have to filter for ARPlaneAnchor
- Visualising Planes
  - We can create an Augmented Reality plane within our App
    - By using the information passed through the renderer() event
    - and our knowledge of creating new SCNNodes (and SCNPlane geometries)
  - We'll do this with our project in the Exercises
- Updating Plane Size
  - As time goes by, ARKit may determine that a plane is bigger than first thought
    - As such, we need to consider what will happen
    - By using a different overloading of renderer() and the guard keyword, we can instead update our AR plane as it changes
- Connecting Assets to Planes
  - Much in the way we attached the SCNPlane to the plane in reality, we can connect other nodes to it as well. Let's consider ART
    - The trick here is that we need to create a new ART for each plane
    - To do this, we would want to re-run a block of code... what construct?
    - We then call that function in our renderer() function

### Demo: Detecting planes

1. Cont'd the Podium project
2. Remove camera node
3. Remove plane from root
4. On the Node Inspector of root
   1. Change Position to 0,0,0
   2. Chnage Scale to 0.1, 0.1, 0.1

8. Change Position of sphere to 0,3,0
9. Change Position of ambient to 0,0,0
10. Change Position of spot to 0,5,0
11. On ViewController.swift

    1. Add `sceneView.debugOptions = [ARSCNDebugOptions.showFeaturePoints, ARSCNDebugOptions.showWorldOrigin]` before `sceneView.scene = scene` inside `viweDidLoad`
    2. Add `configuration.planeDetection = [.horizontal]` after declaration of `configuration` inside `viewWillAppear`
    3. Add below code before `session` function

       - ```swift
          func createFloor(planeAnchor: ARPlaneAnchor) -> SCNNode {
              let node = SCNNode()
              let plane = SCNPlane(width: CGFloat(planeAnchor.extent.x), height: CGFloat(planeAnchor.extent.z))
              node.geometry = plane
              node.eulerAngles.x = -Float.pi / 2
              node.opacity = 0.5
              return node
          }
          func createPodium(planeAnchor: ARPlaneAnchor) -> SCNNode {
              let node = SCNScene(named: "art.scnassets/podium.scn")!.rootNode.clone()
              node.position = SCNVector3(planeAnchor.center.x, 0, planeAnchor.center.z)
              return node
          }

          func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didAdd node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) {
              guard let planeAnchor = anchor as? ARPlaneAnchor else {return}
              let floor = createFloor(planeAnchor: planeAnchor)
              node.addChildNode(floor)
              let podium = createPodium(planeAnchor: planeAnchor)
              node.addChildNode(podium)
          }
          func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, didUpdate node: SCNNode, for anchor: ARAnchor) {
              DispatchQueue.main.async {
                  guard let planeAnchor = anchor as? ARPlaneAnchor else {return}
                  for node in node.childNodes {
                      node.position = SCNVector3(planeAnchor.center.x, 0, planeAnchor.center.z)
                      if let plane = node.geometry as? SCNPlane {
                          plane.width = CGFloat(planeAnchor.extent.x)
                          plane.height = CGFloat(planeAnchor.extent.z)
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
         ```

    4. Remove `let scene = SCNScene(named: "art.scnassets/podium.scn")!` and `sceneView.scene = scene` from `viewDidLoad`

## Interact with an AR App

### Augmented Reality and User Interaction

- Capturing a 'Tapped' Event
  - If we want to allow a user to interact with the AR world by touch, we need to know when they've tapped the screen and when.
  - We will use a UITapGestureRecognizer (part of UIKit) as it can track where it has been touched
- Connecting the Object
  - Tap Gesture Recogniser needs to be connected to a Swift code file to allow us to write code to consider what to do when tapped
  - We also need to ensure it covers the entire View Controller (hence device screen)
- Writing the Code
  - When an action is created, it will pass an input parameter named sender of type UITapGesture-Recognizer
    - This has a property (technically function) location that is used to store where the user tapped
    - Our Scene View has a function named hitTest that determines the plane at a supplied point
    - We can then get the closest (first) plane from there
- Nearest Plane
  - Imagine your finger is a laser pointer. Where that laser pointer shines on is the first plane detected

### Demo: Augmented Reality and User Interaction

1. Cont'd Podium project
2. Change `.horizontal` to `.vertical` in `viewWillAppear`
3. Change `createPodium` function as below

   - ```swift
      func createPodium(result: ARRaycastResult) {
        let podiumScene = SCNScene(named: "art.scnassets/podium.scn")!
        let podiumNode = podiumScene.rootNode
        let planePosition = result.worldTransform.columns.3
        podiumNode.position = SCNVector3(planePosition.x, planePosition.y, planePosition.z)
        sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(podiumNode)
      }
     ```

4. Remove below code from `renderer( didAdd)`

   - ```swift
      let podium = createPodium(planeAnchor: planeAnchor)
      node.addChildNode(podium)
     ```

   - It creates vertical planes.

5. On Main.storyboard

   1. From Object Library, add Tap Gesture Recognizer to Scene View
      1. When you check the Connection Inspector of Tap Gesture Recognizer, Referencing Outlet Collections has connection between qestureRecognizers and Scene View
   2. Click Adjust Editor Options > Assistant
   3. Ctrl + Click Drag from Tap Gesture Recognizer to above `viewDidLoad`

      1. Connection: Action, Object: View Controller, Name: screenTapped, Type: UITapGestureRecognizer > Connect
      2. Add below code into the created function

         - ```swift
            let touchLocation = sender.location(in: sceneView)
            guard let raycastQuery = sceneView.raycastQuery(from: touchLocation, allowing: .estimatedPlane, alignment: .vertical) else {return}
            if let result = sceneView.session.raycast(raycastQuery).first {
                createPodium(result: result)
            }
           ```

### Physics

- The SCNPhysicsBody
  - SCNPhysicsBody is provided by SceneKit to allow a node to participate in a physics simulation
    - Interaction (affection with forces and collisions) can be static (unaffected), dynamic (affected) or kinematic (can only be moved)
    - A Physics Shape must be specified (as different shapes are affected in different ways; consider a spinning coin)
    - The physics shape can just be the geometry passed to the physics body (via the shape)
- Free Falling
  - If I drop a ball, it will just bounce on the ground
    - If we want an object to not just fall down, we must apply a force in another direction on the object
    - If we want to let the user 'push' an obejct in the direction of view, we can use the cameraTransform value to apply a force in the same direction
- Other Programmatic Options
  - A few things to be aware of with Physics Shapes
    - We can pass a type value to our Physics Shape to better model the physics of the object. This lets us choose a level of detail to save processing effort
    - There's another option called collisionMargin which allows us to define how precise a 'hit' must be

### Demo: Physics and Augmented Reality

1. Cont'd Podium project
2. Remove Sphere from podium.scn
3. Add below code to below `createPodium` function on ViewController.swift

   - ```swift
      func createBall() {
          guard let currentFrame = sceneView.session.currentFrame else {return}
          let ball = SCNNode(geometry: SCNSphere(radius: 0.125))
          ball.geometry?.firstMaterial?.diffuse.contents = UIColor.cyan
          let cameraTransform = SCNMatrix4(currentFrame.camera.transform)
          ball.transform = cameraTransform
          let physicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .dynamic, shape: SCNPhysicsShape(node: ball))
          ball.physicsBody = physicsBody
          let power = Float(10.0)
          let force = SCNVector3(-cameraTransform.m31 * power, -cameraTransform.m32 * power, -cameraTransform.m33 * power)
          ball.physicsBody = physicsBody
          ball.physicsBody?.applyForce(force, asImpulse: true)
          sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(ball)
      }
     ```

4. Declare boolean as `podiumAdded` and modify ViewController.swift

   - ```swift
      var podiumAdded = false

      @IBAction func screenTapped(_ sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
          if !podiumAdded {
              ...
              if let result = sceneView.session.raycast(raycastQuery).first {
                  createPodium(result: result)
                  podiumAdded = true
              }
          } else {
              createBall()
          }
      }

      func createPodium(result: ARRaycastResult) {
          ...
          podiumNode.physicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .static, shape: SCNPhysicsShape(node: podiumNode))
          sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(podiumNode)
      }
     ```

### Image Recognition

- Image Detection allows us to determine what actual things are within the view the camera sees
  - We do have to tell ARKit what these objects are first by providing reference images
  - These images are stored in the .xcassets file in the same way images were with a traditional UIKit app
- Reference Images
  - Be aware of the following caveats
    - For each image, you'll need to specify the physical size of the thing in the Attributes Inspector
    - Images can't have an alpha channel (transparency)
    - The higher the contrast and higher the resolution the more chance of discovery
- Swift Code Additions
  - A lot of the heavy lifting is done by ARKit
    - Specify the reference images by creating a ARReference-Image.referenceImages object
    - Pass this into the detectionImages property of the ARWorldTrackingConfiguration you create in viewWillAppear
- Responding to Images
  - The render(..., didAdd node: scnNode, ...) function not only detects planes but also images
    - The difference is the detection of an ARImageAnchor rather than an ARPlaneAnchor
    - These aren't the only two Anchors that can be detected - there's also an ARObjectAnchor
- Properties of an ARImageAnchor
  - The ARImageAnchor has a bunch of useful properties
    - referenceImage is the image in .xcassets that was detected
    - From that, we can determine the physicalSize of the referenceImage as well as the name of the image (so we know which one it is)
    - We can use this information to put a plane on top of the image, perhaps presenting a different image

## Closures and Animation

### Closures

- What are closures?

  - Simply, a funcion used as an input parameter
    - Not quite, it's a block of code that can be used as a value and executed at a later time

- Closure Syntax

  - ```swift
      Let productClosure = { (numbers: [Int]) -> Int in
        // Multiply the numbers together
        return product
      }
    ```

- Calling the Closure

  - Very similar to that of a function, despite the differences so far

    - ```swift
        let productResult = productClosure([14, 378])
        print(productResult) // Outputs 5292
      ```

- Different Types fo Closures
  - Closures are no differnt with combinations of functions
    - If there is no return, the return type must still be specified, but as type Void
    - If there are no input parameters, there will be emplty brackets before the return type
- Remember that Closures can be used as a value
  - As such, they can be passed to a function as a value
  - We can use these with both the sorted function as well as some collection funtions (that act on groups of data)

### Demo: Create a closure

1. Xcode > File > New > iOS > Blank > Next > ClosurePlayground.playground > Create

   - ```swift
      func addition (numbers: [Int]) -> Int {
          var total = 0
          for number in numbers {
              total = total + number
          }
          return total
      }
      print(addition(numbers: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]))

      let addClosure = { (numbers: [Int]) -> Int in
          var total = 0
          for number in numbers {
              total = total + number
          }
          return total
      }
      let add = addClosure([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
      print(add)

      func division (numbers: [Int]) -> Double {
          var divide = 1.0
          for number in numbers {
              divide = divide / Double(number)
          }
          return divide
      }
      print(division(numbers: [2,2]))

      let divClosure = { (numbers: [Int]) -> Double in
          var divide = 1.0
          for number in numbers {
              divide = divide / Double(number)
          }
          return divide
      }
      let div = divClosure([2,2])
      print(div)
     ```

### Defined Functions

- What are defined functions?

  - Built-in functions that use closures as arguments. We will look at four of them
    - `sorted(by:)` used to sort data in a user0supplied fashion
    - `map()` which manipulates each element of an array before making a new one with the elements
    - `filter()` which allows selecting some elements within an array
    - `reduce()` which turns an array into a single value

- Sorting with Sorted

  - `sorted(by:)` will run the content of the closure on every pair of objects in an array
    - It compares the value of the firest object to the second object in the pair
    - If the closure returns true, the objects don't swap
    - If the closure returns false, the objects do swap
    - This repeats, and is the logically the same as BubbleSort
  - Consider an array of structures or classes

    - We can therefore sort via any element of the class/struct
    - For example, a 'Lesson' struct:

      - ```swift
          struct Lesson {
            var name: String
            var number: Int
          }
        ```

  - We create an array of those structs: `lessons = [Lesson(name: "AR", number: 2), Lesson(name: "revision", number: 1)]`
  - Then, sort the array

    - In ascending order - but what if descending?

      - ```swift
          let sortedLessons = lessons.sorted{(first, second) -> Boll in
            return first.number < second.number
          }
        ```

- More on Closures

  - Swift and sorted are smart enough to realise the structure of a closure
    - You can just specify the return and use $0 and $1 to refer to the first/second pair elements
  - There are other alternate syntaxes (slightly) as well

- The Map Function

  - Take each element of an array, and do something to each of them

    - ```swift
      let cities = ["Perth", "Adelaide", "Canberra", "Sydney"]
      let longCities = cities.map{$0 + ", Australia"}
      ```

  - Each element would then be 'Perth, Australia' and so forth

- The Filter Function

  - Inspect each element of the array, and place it in a new array if it meets some condition

    - ```swift
      let guessNumbers = [7, 14, 27, 36, 99, 18, 26]
      let validNumbers = guessNumbers.filter{$0 < 40}
      ```

  - The new validNumbers list wouldn't have 99 in it

- The Reduce Function

  - Combines all elements of the array into a single value

    - ```swift
      let invoiceValues = [279.50, 1000.00, 105.50]
      let invoiceTotal = invoiceValues.reduce(0, {$0 + $1})
      // invocieTotle: 1385.00
      ```

  - The invoiceTotal wuold start at zero and each element wiould be added to the previous.

      var numMap = numbers.map{ (number) in
          return number * 2
      }
      print(numMap)
      // [14, 84, 18, 36, 54]

      var numFilter = numMap.filter { number in
          return number < 20
      }
      print(numFilter)
      // [14, 18]

      var numReduce = numFilter.reduce(0) { currentSum, number in
          return currentSum + number
      }
      print(numReduce)
      // 32
     ```

### Animation Theory

- Animations in Apps
  - Animations can be useful in many types of apps
    - Even in productivity-style apps where subtle animations help direct the user's attention, amongst other things
    - Consider segue animations as an example - the push animation, most notably
    - The following advice has been collated an interpreted from various Apple material
- Directing Attention
  - Using consistent animations makes the app flow and hence the user engaged
  - An animation can signal to the User that something has changed
  - This will then elicit a response from the User
- User Orientation
  - By using consistent animations, users can know where they are in the workflow of an App
  - Consider when launching an App or opening a folder on the Home Screen
  - The 'push' segue in this regard has the same effect; the user knows they are descending down the hierarchy
- Connecting Behaviour
  - Animations should be optional (for accessibility), realistic and also limited
    - Overuse can be uncomfortable and take away from the main purpose of the App
    - When animations are realistic, they ground the App. For example, when the user swipes their finger, and the contents of a list change

### Animations with UIKit

- UIView and animate()
  - UIView provides an animate function (a.k.a. method) that allows you to define animation on views
    - Six properties can be animated: frame, bounds, center, transform, alpha and backgroundColour
    - Three function overloads are provided
    - They're really each just a twist on the same basic thing, but with the option to do extra things
- Animate With Duration

  - Can specify two input parameters to UIView

    - The duration of the animation (in seconds) called withDuration and
    - a closure that specifies what the 'end result' of the animation is named animations

      - ```swift
          UIView.animate(withDuration: 2.0) {
            theView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue
          }
        ```

- Also with a Completion Handler
  - Also have a second closure as the third argument (completion), which is what to do when the animation is finished (after the withDuration)
  - You could make it do another animation (but please don't)
- Also with a Delay or Other Options
  - Can specify the number of seconds to wait before the animation is run as the delay input parameter
  - The options parameter allows non-linear time animations as well as repeat options (as seen in UIViewAnimationOptions)
- Affine Transforms
  - What about that 'transform' property of UIView?
    - Cna supply transformation matrices to map each point of a View to another point
    - There are initialisers to handle the common cases of scaling, rotating and translating to save time and effort
- CGAffineTransform initialisers
  - Examples of the code for each:
    - Scale: CGAffineTransform(scaleX:, scaleY:)
    - Rotate: CGAffineTransform(rotationsAngle:)
    - Translate: CGAffineTransform(translationX:, y:)
  - Go back to the start (i.e. no transformations)
    - CGAffineTransform.identity

### Demo: Animations with UIKit

1. Xcode > File > New > Playground > iOS > Single View > Next > AnimationPlayground.playground > Create
2. Below code will be there

   - ```swift
      import UIKit
      import PlaygroundSupport

      class MyViewController : UIViewController {
          override func loadView() {
              let view = UIView()
              view.backgroundColor = .white

              let label = UILabel()
              label.frame = CGRect(x: 150, y: 200, width: 200, height: 20)
              label.text = "Hello World!"
              label.textColor = .black

              view.addSubview(label)
              self.view = view
          }
      }
      // Present the view controller in the Live View window
      PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = MyViewController()
     ```

3. Change label to square

   - ```swift
      let square = UIView()
      square.frame = CGRect(x: 175, y: 200, width: 50, height: 50)
      square.backgroundColor = .black

      view.addSubview(square)
     ```

4. Scale Animation

   - ```swift
      UIView.animate(withDuration: 10, delay: 10, options: [.repeat, .autoreverse], animations: {
          square.alpha = 0.5
          square.backgroundColor = .blue
          square.frame = CGRect(x: 100, y: 200, width: 100, height: 100)
      }) { (_) in
          square.frame = CGRect(x: 175, y: 200, width: 50, height: 50)
          square.alpha = 1.0
          square.backgroundColor = .black
      }
     ```

5. Multiple Animations

   - ```swift
      UIView.animate(withDuration: 2, delay: 0, options: [.repeat, .autoreverse], animations: {
          square.alpha = 0.5
          square.backgroundColor = .blue
          let affineScale = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 2, y: 2)
          let affineRotates = CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: .pi)
          let affineTranslate = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 50, y: 50)
          let combined = affineScale.concatenating(affineRotates).concatenating(affineTranslate)
          square.transform = combined
      })
     ```

## Communicating with the Web

### "Interweb" Fundamentals

- What's in an Address?
  - URL: Uniform Resource Locator:
  - Protocols:
    - http:// Hypertext Trnasfer Protocol
    - https:// Hypertext Trnasfer Protocol - Secure
- What else is there
  - Domain: curtin.edu.au
  - Subdomain: scieng.curtin.edu.au
  - Port: 80(HTTP) or 443(HTTPS)
  - Path: <https://scieng.curtin.edu.au/research/institues-centres-and-grops/>
  - Query Parameters: give more information to the server about a request, like Swift dictionaries:
    - <https://www.amazon.com.au/s?k=stan_grant&ref=nb_sb_noss_2>
  - Request type i.e. the HTTP method, e.g. GET, POST
  - Header: tell the server how to deal with request
  - Body: data sent (request) or received (response)

### Requests and Responses

- How does it all work in Swift?

  - Create a URL; `let url = URL(string: "https://www.curtin.edu.au")!`
  - Create a network request and execute it
  - A data task must be created:

    - `URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url, completionHandler: @escaping (Data?, Response?, Error?)) ->Void)`
    - Data?: this is ther response's body, the requested data
    - URLResopnse?: information about the response
    - Error?: errors that occurred

  - ```swift
      let url = URL(string: "https://www.curtin.edu.au")!

      let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) {
        (data, response, error) in
        if let data = data {
          print(data)
        }
      }
      task.resume()
      // 100593 bytes
    ```

  - ```swift
      import UIKit
      import PlaygroundSupport

      PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true

      let url = URL(string: "https://www.curtin.edu.au")!

      let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) {
        (data, response, error) in
        if let data = data,
          let string - String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
            print(string)
          }
          PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
      }
      task.resume()
      // html code
    ```

- Application Programming Interface
  - Also knwo as APIs for short
  - An API allows two pieces of software to talk to each other through providing routines, protocols or tools
  - The frameworks we have used are APIs
  - An API on the web is a web service enabling the transferring of data using network requests
- Using APIs
  - APIs read the path and query parameters
  - Web servers process these to respond correctly
  - Data publicly available data through web services give examples of how to construct URLs for data retrieval
- Example of an API Request
  - `let url = URL(string: "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY")!`
- Modifying URLs
  - Use URLComponents with individual components to dynamically update the query in a URL
  - Query parameters are supplied as a Dictionary and can be used to update URLs when queries need to be changed
  - Simply add and call the extension URL{} function
- Using extension URL

  - ```swift
      import UIKit
      import PlaygroundSupport

      PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true

      extension URL {
        func withQueries(_ queries: [String: String]) -> URL? {
          var components = URLComponents(url: self, resolveingAgainstBaseURL: true)
          components?.queryItems = queries.map {
            URLQueryItem(name: $0.0, value: $0.1)
          }
          return components?.url
        }
      }

      let baseURL = URL(string: "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY")!

      let query:[String: String] = ["api_key": "DEMO_KEY", "date": "2022-09-16"]

      let url = baseURL.withQueryies(query)!

      let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) {
        (data, response, error) in
        if let data = data,
          let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
            print(string)
          }
          PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
      }
      task.resume()
    ```

## An Introduction to JSON - JSON and Swift Types

- JSON Introduction
  - JSON: JavaScript Obejct Notation
  - Data returned from the web is often JSON
- JSON Example

  - ```json
    {
      "name": "David",
      "partner": {
        "p_name": "Andrew"
      }
    }
    ```

- JSON and Swift
  - {} Curly brackets are found in dictionaries
  - [] Square brackets are found in arrays
  - Text inside of quotation marks " " means we have strings
  - Numbers and Boolean values don't have quotation marks
- JSON Expanded

  - ```json
    {
      "name": "David",
      "partners": [
        {
          "p_name": "Andrew"
        },
        {
          "p_name": "Dave"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

- JSON Data to Swift Types
  - Conveting to Swift we will use `JSONDecoder`
  - Accepts parameters: type Type and Data
  - Attempts to decode the Data object
  - Must conform to Codable protocol
- Into Our Own Model Objects

  - ```swift
    struct NASAImageInfo {
      var title: String
      var description: String
      var url: URL
      var copyright: String?
    }
    ```

- `CodingKeys` and `CodingKey`

  - ```swift
    struct Car: Codable {
      let yearModel: Date
      let colour: String
      let manufacturer: String

      enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case yearModel = "manufactured_year"
        case colour: "paintColour"
        case manufacturer = "make"
      }
    }
    ```

- init(form decoder: Decoder) throws
  - The `init` method must be implemented
  - Ignore key/value pairs we will not use in our model
  - It is a throwing function
- What will we have?
  - Our own model and object
  - It will have its properties
  - An enumeration `CodingKeys`
  - An initializer `init(from:)`
- Completion Handler Request
  - Our model's initializer is ready
  - `JSONDecoder` uses this to put the JSON into our model
  - Completion handler must be updated
- Working Smoothly with JSON
  - JSON can be complex: nexted data structures, multiple data types
  - Check your code matches the structure
  - `CodingKeys` enumeration must match
  - Network connections can fail
  - URL and the returned response
- Structuring Your Project
  - Where do we put this code?
  - In its own file?
  - In a function?
  - Where do we call it from?
  - How do we reuse it?
- Completion Handler
  - Network request is created
  - Code, completion handler, added to the URLSession
  - Network session ends, completion handler executes
  - As the developer we write that handler
- When it Fails
  - What do we do when things don't go as planned?
  - Network fails
  - JSON cannot be decoded

### Demo: JSON and Swift Types

```swift
import UIKit
import PlaygroundSupport

PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true

## Concurrency and the Web

### Concurrency

- Concurrency: The fact of two or more events or circumstances happening or existing at the same time
  - On iOS multiple things can happen at the same time
  - Multiple things happening concurrently wasn't always possible
  - Multicore processors facilitate multiple things to happen at once
- Grand Central Dispatch
  - An iOS technology managing multiple things simultaneously
  - Manages what is being processed at any given time
  - Manages things on different queues
  - Processes things with different priority levels
- Different Queues of Threads
  - Queues are software abstractions on top of multicore processing
  - We tell our code which thread to run on
  - The main queue executes the majority of the code
  - The main queue has the highest priority
- Prioritising
  - User interface, user input thread: highest priority
  - Background queues have lower priority
  - Long operations usually have lower priority
- Data from the Web
  - `URLSession` network requests run on low priority queues
  - Grabbing stuff from the Web, things can go wrong
  - User interface code is always on the main queue
- DispatchQueue
  - Is used to put user interface code onto the main thread
  - `DispatchQueue.main.async { // our code goes in herre }`
- Displaying Retrieved Data
  - When we are pulling data down off the web, we need to think through how we will display this to the user
  - Once we have thought it through we need to design our interface to be able to do that which we have designed
- What can go wrong?
  - The web is volatile, things can go wrong
  - The web is volatile, things can change
  - Errors occur, and they may not be our errors
- App Transport Security (ATS) error
  - ATS is designed for security and privacy
  - It requires HTTPS network connections
  - The best resolution: all requests use HTTPS
  - To temporarily fix this, update the Info.plist file
- Network Activity Indicator
  - Show the user something is happening
  - Enable the network Activity Indicator
  - Simply set the visible property to true at the start
  - Set the visible property to false upon completion

              self.title = photoInfo.title
              self.descriptionLabel.text = photoInfo.description
              if let copyright = photoInfo.copyright {
                  self.copyrightLabel.text = "Copyright \(copyright)"
              } else {
                  self.copyrightLabel.isHidden = true
              }
          }
        ```

8. Debugging

   1. Click PhotoInfoController.swift

      1. Click the number line of `completion(photoInfo)`
      2. Add `print(photoInfo)` to under `completion(photoInfo)`
      3. Click Start the active scheme
      4. It returned

         - ```console
            2022-09-27 19:43:41.454099-0700 NASADailyPhoto[36114:1556726] [boringssl] boringssl_metrics_log_metric_block_invoke(153) Failed to log metrics
            Either no data was returned or data was not decoded correctly!
           ```

           - No data was because copyright was nil. ~~When I hid copyright from PhotoInfo.swift and ViewController.swift, it got the data~~
           - change copyright in init to `try?`
           - On PhotoInfo.swift

             - ```swift
                init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
                    ...
                    self.copyright = try? valueContainer.decode(String.self, forKey: CodingKeys.copyright)
                }
               ```

         - `Thread 2: "Modifications to the layout engine must not be performed from a background thread after it has been accessed from the main thread."`
         - Swift 4, must be used from main thread only warning

           - Wrap the code with `DispatchQueue.main.async{}`
           - On ViewController.swift

             - ```swift
                photoInfoController.fetchPhotoInfo {(photoInfo) in
                    guard let photoInfo = photoInfo else {return}
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        self.title = photoInfo.title
                        self.descriptionLabel.text = photoInfo.description
                        if let copyright = photoInfo.copyright {
                            self.copyrightLabel.text = "Copyright \(copyright)"
                        } else {
                            self.copyrightLabel.isHidden = true
                        }
                    }
                }
               ```

9. Download an image from the url

   1. On ViewController.swift

      1. Modify `viewDidLoad()` and add `updateUI`

         - ```swift
            override func viewDidLoad() {
                super.viewDidLoad()
                descriptionLabel.text = ""
                copyrightLabel.text = ""

                photoInfoController.fetchPhotoInfo {(photoInfo) in
                    if let photoInfo = photoInfo {
                        self.updateUI(with: photoInfo)
                    }
                }
            }

            func updateUI(with photoInfo: PhotoInfo) {
                print(photoInfo.url)
                let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: photoInfo.url, completionHandler: {(data, response, error) in

                        guard let data = data,
                              let image = UIImage(data: data) else {return}

                        DispatchQueue.main.async {
                            self.title = photoInfo.title
                            self.imageView.image = image
                            self.descriptionLabel.text = photoInfo.description
                            if let copyright = photoInfo.copyright {
                                self.copyrightLabel.text = "Copyright \(copyright)"
                            } else {
                                self.copyrightLabel.isHidden = true
                            }
                        }
                    }
                )
                task.resume()
            }
           ```

   2. On Main.storyboard
      1. Click ImageView and Add Constraints
         1. Check Aspect Ratio and click Add 1 constraint

## Errors

### "this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key counter"

- This means there was something called 'counter' which it can no longer find.
- It's because I changed the label name after connect it from 'counter' to 'counterDisplay'
- Solution:
  1. Click the label on `Main.storyboard`
  2. Control + drag the label to the 'counterDisplay' on `ViewController.swift`
  3. Click "Show the connection inspector" on the Utility Area (the right hand side)
  4. You can see there are two connections on Referencing Outlets
  5. Remove 'counter' from it

### "Failed to instantiate the default view controller for UIMainStoryboardFile"

- If you accidentally deleted that view controller, or otherwise made it not the default, then you‚Äôll see the error ‚ÄúFailed to instantiate the default view controller for UIMainStoryboardFile 'Main' - perhaps the designated entry point is not set?‚Äù when your app launches, along with a plain black screen.
