### Constants and Variables

- Variable: store a value in memory
  - `var <variable_name> = <variable_value>`
- Constant: store a value that won't change, in memory
  - `let <constant_name> = <constant_value>`

### Data Types

- Defining a variable's data type to be stored in a variable happens when carting it
  - `var <variable_name>: <data_type> = <variable_value>`
  - |Type Name|Symbol|Purpose|Example|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |Interger|Int|For whole numbers, integers|4|
    |Double|Double|Numbers with decimal points|4.6|
    |Boolean|Bool|True or False|true|
    |String|String|Text|"Here"|

### Operators

- Are symbols, singular or combined, that allow you to check, change or combine values
  - |Operator Name|Symbol|Purpose|Example|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |Assignment| = |Assign a value to a variable|Greeting = "Hello"|
    |Addition| + |Add the values together|25 + 25 = 50|
    |Subtraction| - |Subtract the values|22 - 11 = 11|
    |Multiplication| * |Multiply the values together|4 * 7 = 28|
    |Division| / |Divide the values|12 / 4 = 3|
    |Remainder|%|Returns the remainder of dividing the numbers|12 % 5 = 2|

## Control Flow and Advanced Variables

### if-else

- ```swift
  if <condition> {
    <code to execute when condition is true>
  } else {
    <code to execute when condition is false>
  }
  ```

### Logical Operators

- |Operator|Description|
  |---|---|
  | == |The items must be equal to each other|
  | != |The values must not be equal to each other|
  | > |The value on the left is greather than the value on the right|
  | >= |The value in the left is greather than or equal to the value on the right|
  | < |The value on the left is smaller than the value on the right|
  | <= |The value on the left is smaller than or equal to the value on the right|
  | && |AND - the condition on the left must be true AND the condition on the right must be true|
  | &#124;&#124; |OR - the condition on the left must be true OR the condition on the right must be true|
  | ! |NOT - the opposite of the conditional statement immediately following the operator is returned|
  
### Switch

- ```swift
  var numberOfSiblings: Int = 2
  switch numberOfSiblings {
  case 0:
    print("only child")
  case 1:
    print("A single sibling")
  case 2:
    print("Two siblings")
  default:
    print("Wow...")
    
  // result: "Two siblings"
  ```

- Comparison Range

  - `...` or `..<`
    - `case 0..<2: // equal to 0...1`

### Collecgions

#### Array

- An ordered list of data of the same type
  - `var myIntegerList: [Int] = [1,2,3,4]`
  
- Data in an array is accessed by its index number
  - `print(myIntegerList[0] // returns 1`
  
- Operations that can be performed upon an array
  - |Operation name|Description|
    |---|---|
    |<array_name>.contains(x)|If x is in the array, returns true else false|
    |<array_name>.isEmpty|Returns true if array is empty, otherwise returns false|
    |<array_name>.append(x)|Appends x to the end of the array|
    |<array_name>.insert(x, at:y)|Inserts x into the array at position y|
    |<array_name>.remove(at:y)|Removes the item at position y in the array|
    |<array_name>.removeLast()|Removes the last item in the array|
    |<array_name>.removeAll()|Removes everything from the array|

#### Dictionary

- An unordered collection, and there is a key and a value
  - `var myDictionary = ["Name": "Jin", "Age": 20]
  
- Accessing a Key's value is done using if-let

  - ```swift
    if let age = myDictionary["Age"]{
      print(age)
    }
    ```

  - This ensures that the key exists before attempting to do anything with a value

- Changing a Dictionary

  - ```swift
    myDictionary["Age"] = 22 // replace the value if the key exists
    myDictionary.updateValue(39, forKey: "Age") // update
    myDictionary.removeValue(forKey: "Age") // remove
    ```

### for-in

- Allows us to repeat something that is in a sequence or range or collection

  - ```swift
    for num in 10...15{
      print("Number is: \(num)")
    }
    /* return
     * Number is: 10
     * Number is: 11
     * Number is: 12
     * Number is: 13
     * Number is: 14
     * Number is: 15
     */
     
    var lectures = ["David", "Paul", "Andrew"]
    for lecture in lectures{
      print("Lecturer is: \(lecturer)")
    }
    /* return
     * Lecturer is David
     * Lecturer is Paul
     * Lecturer is Andrew
     */
     
    var ages = ["David": 20, "Paul": 30, "Andrew": 40]
    for person in ages{
      print(person)
      print(person.key)
    }
    /* return
     * (key: "Andrew", value: 40)
     * Andrew
     * (key: "Paul", value: 30)
     * Paul
     * (key: "David", value: 20)
     * David
     */
    ```

### while

- Keeps looping until a condition is met

  - ```swift
    var points = 5
    var numberOfServes = 1
    while points < 50 && numberOfServes < 3{
      print("Playon, points = \(points)")
      points = points * 2
      numberOfServes = numberOfServes + 1
    }
    /* return
     * Playon, points = 5
     * Playon, points = 10
     */
    ```

### Add the button action

1. Control + click the button on the storyboard and drag the bottom to line 16 (between the last two brackets) on `ViewController.swift`
2. Change the type to "UIButton"
3. Name: textChange
4. Click Connect
5. Control + click the label on the storyboard and drag the bottom to line 11 (under the UIViewController line) on `ViewController.swift`
6. Name: theMessage
7. Click Connect
8. Type action code

   - ```swift
     theMessage.text = "I'm an app developer"
     print("You pressed the button!")
     ```

9. When you click the button, you can see the text appear at the bottom of your screen, in the debug area

## Developer Documentation

- Hover over the UIlabel
- While you've got the Option key down, a question mark appears
- Click the question mark
- The developer documentation has ginve you a brief summary
- Click "Open in Developer Documentation"

## Debugging

- Compiler Errors
  - When the run button is clicked, Xcode takes the code you wrote, combines it with the code in things such as UILabel & creates an executeable file
  - This is called comiling your code
  - The executable file is what runs on the device
  - When the code can't compile, a compiler error occurs
  - These usually occur when the written code has an error in it
- Run time Errors
  - These are what are really referred to as Bugs
  - The code compiles without errors and starts executing
  - While running the code stops or crashes
  - This is where the code did something it wasn't meant to and can't continue on
  - Most of use have experienced these when using software, and they avr frustrating for both users and developers
  
## Exercise

### Change Label

        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.orange
      default:
        theMessage.text = "It's an unknown colour entered."
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Temperature Converter

- ```swift
  import UIKit

  class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var celsiusInput: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var fahrenheitInput: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet weak var convertedValue: UILabel!

    var degreesValue: Double? = 100
    var fahrenheitValue: Double? = 0.0

    override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
      // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    @IBAction func celToFah(_ sender: Any) {
      fahrenheitInput.text = ""
      if celsiusInput.text != ""{
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.green
        degreesValue = Double(celsiusInput.text!)

        fahrenheitValue = (degreesValue! * 9/5) + 32
        convertedValue.text = "\(fahrenheitValue!) Fahrenheit"
        print("\(degreesValue!) = \(fahrenheitValue!) in fahrenheit.")
      } else {
        convertedValue.text = "Enter Celsius Value"
      }
    }
    @IBAction func fahToCel(_ sender: Any) {
      celsiusInput.text = ""
      if fahrenheitInput.text != "" {
        view.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellow
        fahrenheitValue = Double(fahrenheitInput.text!)
        degreesValue = (fahrenheitValue! - 32) * 5/9
        convertedValue.text = "\(degreesValue!) Degrees"
        print("\(fahrenheitValue!) = \(degreesValue!) in degrees.")
      } else {
        convertedValue.text = "Enter Fahrenheit Value"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Functions

- Functions are blocks of code that can be run over and over again to do the same things
- They saves us writing out code over and over again, possibly introducing transcription errors
- Functions should do one thing. If we want to do two things, we can write two functions
- A function has two important components
  1. The function definition, where we specify what the function does.
     - A function definition has four components: name, input parameters, output return values and the body
     - The function body is what turns the inputs into the outputs.
     - `func functionName (InputParameters) -> OutputReturnType { // FunctionBody }`
  2. The function call, where we execute the function
     - `functionName()`

### Function Parameters

- They allow us to specify the name, type and quantity of data that will be processed by the function body.
- When we call the function, we can apply the same steps to different data
- There are three board situations to consider:
  - functions with no input parameter
    - definition: `functionName() {}`
    - call: `functionName()`
  - functions with one input parameter
    - definition: `functionName(parameter: type) {}`
    - call: `functionName(parameter: value)`
    - We must specify a name for the parameter that describes its purpose
    - The parameter becomes a variable we can use within the function
    - We also have to specify the data type of the parameter
  - functions with multiple input parameters:
    - definition: `functionName(firstParameter:dataType, secondParameter:dataType) {}`
    - call: `functionName(firstParameter: value, secondParameter: value)`
    - a function should only do one thing; if we have too many (approx. > 6) parameters, it is likely doing to much
- Default Parameter Values
  - When calling the funciton, we don't have to specify all the parameters
  - If we don't we need a default value to use so the function can still run
  - We should have the default parameters at the end of the parameter list
    - This ensures that all calls to the function use the same order for their non-default arguments, and makes it cleear that the same function is being called in each case
  - definitions: `functionName(firstParameter: Int, secondParameter: Int = 10) {}`

### Function Returns

- The value(s) we calculated within the function can be used outside the function
- when calling functions that return, we don't have to have the smae names for the variables storing the returns as within the function
- No reutrns
- One return
  - All that is required is to make the last line of the function start with return, then specify the variable containing the value to return
  - If you return earlier in the function, any lines afterwards will be ignored
  - `return value`
- Multiple returns
  - All we have to do is separate the returns by a comma

- function definition

  - ```swift
    func thisDivides(number: Int) -> (Int, Int) {
      let value1 = number / 2
      let value2 = number / 4
      return (value1, value2)
    }
    ```

- function call

  - ```swift
    var (div_two, div_four) = thisDivides(number: 16)
    print(div_two) // 8
    print(div_four) // 4
    ```

- Exercise: Multiple Returns
  - Define a function called 'calcSumDiff' that for two input parameters 'firstNum' and 'secondNum' will output the sum and the difference of the two numbers.
  - Call your function and store the results in appropriately named variables.
- Then, print the values of these to confirm the function works as intended

  - ```swift
    func calcSumDiff(firstNum: Int, secondNum: Int) -> (Int, Int) {
      let sum = firstNum + secondNum
      let diff = abs(firstNum - secondNum)
      return (sum, diff)
    }

    let result = calcSumDiff(firstNum: 10, secondNum: 12)
    print(result) \\ return (22, 2)
    ```

## Structures

- A Structure contains one or more variables (called properties)

  - ```swift
    struct Person { var anme: string }
    var aPreson = Person(name: "Tim")
    print(aPerson.name)
    // return Tim
    ```

- We can also add methods (functions) to it as well

  - ```swift
    struct Person {
      var name: String
      var age: Int
      var location: String

      func whoAmI() {
        print("Hi, I'm \(name)! I'm \(age) and live in \(location)")
      }
    }
    
    let aPerson = Person(name: "Jin", age: 20, location: "Victoria")
    
    print(aPerson.name) // Jin
    aPerson.whoAmI()   // Hi, I'm Jin! I'm 20 and live in Victoria
    ```

- An `initializer` creates an instance of a structure
  - This involves creating an instance of each property
  - We can specify default values for the properties

  - ```swift
    struct WaterMeter {
      var litersUsed: Int = 0
      var customer: Person = Person(name: "Anonymous", age: 20, location: "Canada")
    }

    let theMeter = WaterMeter()

    print(theMeter.litersUsed)  // 0
    print(theMeter.customer.age) // 20
    ```

- When we specify the values when we create an instance, this is called using the `memberwise initializer`
  - `var aWaterMeter = WaterMeter(literUsed: 10)`
- `Custom Initializer`: In more complicated situations, we may wish to write our own initializer functions

  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      var kph: Double   // only kph is stored
      init(kph: Double) { // Basic initializer for kph
        self.kph = kph
      }
      init(mph: Double) { // Advaced logic in initializer for mph
        self.kph = mph * 1.6
      }
    }
    var firstSpeed = CarSpeed(kph: 100)
    var sameSpeed = CarSpeed(mph: 60)
    ```

- `Computed Properties`

  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      var kph: Double
      var nph: Double {
        return kph / 1.6
      }
    }
    ```

- `Mutating Methods`: Added methods to a structure that change the values of the properties
 
  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      var kph: Int = 0
      mutating func reset() {
        kph = 0
      }
    }
    var myCarSpeed = CarSpeed(kph: 100) // kph is 100
    myCarSpeed.reset()         // kph is 0
    ```

- Type Properties and Methods stay the same for all instances of a structure
  - Add `static` before a property or method

  - ```swift
    struct CarSpeed {
      static var legalLimit = 100
    }
    ```

- `self` simply refers to the current instance of a structure (or other object)
- This allows us to interact with the current instance, for example to set or access its properties

- Exercise: Detailed Person
  - Modify the Person structure such that we also store their favourite food and their height. Choose appropriate data types for these properties.
  - Add a second function to the Person structure named 'foodAndHeight' to output these new properties in a human-readable manner.

- Initialise the Structure you've created, and call your new function to confirm the changes work as intended

  - ```swift
    struct Person {
      var name: String;
      var age: Int;
      var location: String;
      var favouriteFood: String;
      var height: Int;

      func whoAmI() {
        print("Hi, I'm \(name)! I'm \(age) and live in \(location).");
      }

      func foodAndHeight() {
        print("My favourite Food is \(favouriteFood), and I'm \(height)cm tall.")
      }
    }
    let bPerson = Person(name: "Jin", age: 20, location: "Canada", favouriteFood: "Galbi", height: 180);
    bPerson.foodAndHeight() // returns My favourite Food is Galbi, and I'm 180cm tall.
    ```

## Classes

- Classes differ from structures as classes can hoave hierarchical relationship
- Classes can have parents (named superclasses) or children (named subclasses)

- Base Classes don't have a parent

  - ```swift
    class Animal {
      var animalName: String
      var numberOfLimbs: Int
      func makeNoise() {
        //
      }
    }
    ```

- Subclassing allows us to extend an existing class by basing it on an existing class (and its methods and properties)

  - ```swift
    class Dog:Animal {
      var breed: String
      override function makeNoise() {
        print("Woof!")
      }
    }
    ```

- If we add more properties to our subclass, we need to override the initializer as it will only initialize the superclasses' properties

  - ```swift
    class Dog:Animal {
      var breed: String
      init(animalName: String, numberOfLimbs: Int, Breed: String) {
        self.breed = breed
        super.init(animalName: animalName, numberOfLimbs: numberOfLimbs)
      }
    }
    ```

- ```swift
  class Animal {
    var name: String
    var numberOfLimbs: Int

    func makeNoise() {
      // Do nothing!
    }
    init(name: String, numberOfLimbs: Int) {
      self.name = name
      self.numberOfLimbs = numberOfLimbs
    }
  }

  class Cat: Animal {
    var breed: String = ""

    override func makeNoise() {
      print("Meow!")
    }

    init(name: String, numberOfLimbs: Int, breed: String) {
      self.breed = breed
      super.init(name: name, numberOfLimbs: numberOfLimbs)
    }
  }

  let myCat = Cat(name: "Whiskers", numberOfLimbs: 4, breed: "Ragdoll")
  print(myCat.name)
  myCat.makeNoise()

  let myAnimal = Animal(name: "Miscellaneous", numberOfLimbs: 0)
  print(myAnimal.name)
  myAnimal.makeNoise()

  print(myCat.breed)
  ```

- Exercise: Another Animal
  - Create a new Subclass of Animal for a Snake. It should store a true or false value regarding whether it is poisonous, a value of its length as well as ensuring its makeNoise function outputs a 'Hiss'.
  - Ensure that you have define the initialiser for the Snake.

- As snakes can be (for this purpose) considered to have zero limbs, pass the value directly into the superclass initialiser

  - ```swift
    class Snake:Animal {
      var poisonous: Bool = false;
      var snakeLength: Double

      override func makeNoise() {
        print("Hiss")
      }
      init(animalName: String, numberOfLimbs: Int = 0, poisonous: Bool, snakeLength: Double) {
        self.poisonous = poisonous
        self.snakeLength = snakeLength
        super.init(animalName: animalName, numberOfLimbs: numberOfLimbs)
      }
    }
    let aSnake = Snake(animalName: "Bell Snake", poisonous: true, snakeLength: 100)
    let bSnake = Snake(animalName: "Bella Snake", numberOfLimbs: 4, poisonous: true, snakeLength: 100.3)

    aSnake.makeNoise()     // Hiss
    print(aSnake.numberOfLimbs) // 0
    print(aSnake.snakeLength)  // 100.0

    bSnake.makeNoise()     // Hiss
    print(bSnake.numberOfLimbs) // 4
    print(bSnake.snakeLength)  // 100.3
    ```

## Introduction to User Interface Development

### Basic Views

- User Interface Components: Apple's UIKit provides us with the components we can use to make our own
- Views: A view is a visual element that makes up our app
  - We can create text, graphics, lines and more with them
  - Most apps contain screens which are made up of many niews, which create what is termed a view hierarchy
  - Views need a Frame (size and position) first
- UIView: The UIView class is UIKit's foundational class
  - This is subclassed to make many components we can use to build our app's interface
- UILabel: A UILabel allows us to display a piece of short text (in our app) to the user
- UIImageView: It allows us to display an image to the user
- UITextView: It allows a user to interact with multiple lines of test within the app
- UIScrollView: It allows users to scroll
  - The benefit of this is to add and explore content larget than the viewport (screen/window)
  - Scrollbars (or indicators as they termed) only appear when the user scrolls
- UIToolbar: It displays a group of buttons at the bottom of the screen (usually)
  - Buttons (or tools) allow users to perform an action
- UINavigationBar: It can be thought of as the 'title bar' - but isn't the only way to make one
  - It has buttons to navigate through the view hierarchy (back, forwards etc)
  - It looks like it sometimes has other buttons (although they are not implemented using a UINavigationBar)
- UITabBar: It looks similar to a UIToolbar, but serves a different yet similar purpose
  - Rather than performing actions, a UITabBar allows the user to select between views
  - It's used in conjunction with a TabBarController
  - It is best used for when the app has multiple workflows i.e. doesn't just run from start to finish like a 'wizard'

#### Playgounds Basic Views

- in Cocoa Touch
  - Xcode > File > New > Playground > iOS > Single View

  - ```swfit
    //: A UIKit based Playground for presenting user interface

    import UIKit
    import PlaygroundSupport

    class MyViewController : UIViewController {
      override func loadView() {
        let view = UIScrollView()
        view.backgroundColor = .white
        view.contentSize = CGSize(width: 375, height: 1000)

        let label = UILabel()
        label.frame = CGRect(x: 50, y: 200, width: 200, height: 20)
        label.text = "Hello World!"
        label.textColor = .black

        view.addSubview(label)

        let textView = UITextView()
        textView.frame = CGRect(x:50, y:240, width: 200, height: 100)
        textView.text = "Tap to edit me - I'm a TextView!"
        textView.textColor = .black

        view.addSubview(textView)

        self.view = view
      }
    }
    // Present the view controller in the Live View window
    PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = MyViewController()
    ```

- in SwiftUI
  - Xcode > File > New > Playground > iOS > Blank

  - ```swift
    import SwiftUI
    import PlaygroundSupport

    struct Name {
      var firstName: String = ""
      var lastName: String = ""
    }

    struct NameRow: View {
      var name: Name
      var body: some View {
        HStack {
          Text(name.firstName)
          Text(name.lastName).bold()
        }
      }
    }

    struct NameView: View {
      var body: some View {
        Group {
          NameRow(name: Name(firstName: "Jin", lastName: "Park")).offset(x:1, y:0)
          NameRow(name: Name(firstName: "Jina", lastName: "Park")).offset(x:0, y:0)
        }
      }
    }

    PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(NameView().padding(150))
    ```

### Basic Controls

- Controls allow us to setup Actions that respond to events (interactions) with the controls
  - An Action is simply a special type of function
- UIButton: It is a control which the user can 'tap'
- UISegmentedCongrol: Think of a UISegmentedControl as a group of buttons where only one can be selected
  - Code is run when the user selects a different button
- UITextField: It is similar to a UITextView or a UILabel
  - In that it allows the user to enter a single line of text - these are properties of those Views
  - Code can also be bound to after each keystroke (use this carefully)
- UISlider: It allows the user to select a continuous value between a lower and upper range
  - As the user drags the slider toggle, code is run, so dragging can trigger an event many times
- UISwitch: They are to controls what Boolean values are to variables
  - Code can run for when the state changes or when it is set to a specific value
- UIDatePicker: It sllows the user to select a date and time
  - Code is executed when date and/or time is changed
- UIViewController: It is not really a control, but a special case view
  - Each screen in an app is usually a scene in Storyboards
  - UIViewControllers manage each view - they contain the Actions and the Storyboards used to generate each screen or scene
  - These are subclassed and overridden to allow us to make our own scenes

#### Playgrounds: Basic Controls

- in SwiftUI
  - Xcode > File > New > Playgrounds > iOS > blank

  - ```swift
    import SwiftUI
    import PlaygroundSupport

    struct AToggle: View {
      @State var isToggled = false
      var offDescription: String
      var onDescription: String
      var body: some View {
        Toggle(isOn: $isToggled) {
          if(isToggled) {
            Text(onDescription)
          } else {
            Text(offDescription)
          }
        }
      }
    }

    struct MainView: View {
      var body: some View {
        VStack {
          Group {
            AToggle(offDescription: "Off 1", onDescription: "On 1")
            AToggle(offDescription: "Off 2", onDescription: "On 2")
          }
          Button(action: {
            print("Tapped")
          }, label: {
            Text("I am a button!")
          })
        }
      }
    }

    PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(MainView().padding(150))
    ```

- in Cocoa Touch

  - ```swift
    import UIKit
    import PlaygroundSupport

    class MyViewController : UIViewController {
      @objc func buttonTapped() {
        print("Tapped the button!")
      }
      @objc func datePickerValueChanged() {
        print("Changed value of the date picker!")
      }
      override func loadView() {
        let view = UIScrollView()
        view.backgroundColor = .white
        view.contentSize = CGSize(width: 375, height: 1000)

        let button = UIButton()
        button.frame = CGRect(x:0, y: 20, width: 100, height: 20)
        button.setTitle("Tap Me", for: .normal)
        button.setTitleColor(.blue, for: .normal)
        button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(buttonTapped), for: .touchDown)

        view.addSubview(button)

        let datePicker = UIDatePicker()
        datePicker.frame = CGRect(x:0, y: 0, width: 375, height: 500)
        datePicker.addTarget(self, action: #selector(datePickerValueChanged), for: .valueChanged)

        view.addSubview(datePicker)
        self.view = view
      }
    }
    // Present the view controller in the Live View window
    PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = MyViewController()
    ```

## Scenes

- A scene is simply 'one thing' we can do in our app that is described by 'one screen'
- Complex apps will require multiple scenes to be able to deliver the required functionality

### Segues

- A `segue` defines how a new ViewController appears over the previous ViewController
- We can also use `segues` to dismiss View Controllers to move back to previous ones, and these are termed `modal segues`.

### Triggers

- Segues can be triggered either using the Interface Builder or programmatically using Swift code
  - We generally connect the trigger to a control such as a button, so the segue is triggered when the user taps the button

### Unwinding

- Dismissing a segue is termed `unwinding` it
  - We can't really do this using Interface Builder
  - We do this programmatically by creating an `IBAction` function that takes a `UIStoryboardSegue` parameter
  - We then need to connect the IBAction to a control, which we will do in the exercise

### Navigation Controllers

- Using a Navigation Controller we can push a new ViewController on top of the stack with a push transition

### Navigation Bars and Items

- This can be cusstomised visually in Interface Builder, keeping in mind the Human Interface guidelines
- The Navigation Bar is implemented ad a `UINavigationBar`
- To customize what the bar says, we need to modify the Navigation Item within our View Controller
- We can customize the style by modifying the attributes of the Navigation Bar

### Passing Information

- Generally, we will need to pass information between View Controllers
  - This is despite changing View Controllers to a different `task`, as it is still part of a larger workflow
- We override the prepare function to setup data for transfer during a segue
- The prepare function is how we programmatically define a segue

## Tab Bar Controllers

- Tab Bar Controllers are commonly seen in many apps to separate different workflows within an App
- To add a Tab Bar Controller in Interface Builder, we drag it onto the Canvas from the Object library
- To add a tab, we drag it from the Object library into our TabBarController
- Each of these tabs is termed a Tab Bar Item
- Tab Bar Item has a Label and an Image
  - We can use a bunch of built-in icons or supply our own
- We can customise the look and feel further using Swift code

## ViewController Event Handling

- Life Cycle States
  - A View Controller can be in one of the following states:
    - View not loaded
    - View appearing
    - View appeared
    - View disappearing
    - View disappeared
- View Did Load
  - The most common function is viewDidLoad, which runs when the View Controller is loaded
  - Generally this function is used to programmatically initialise the View Controller
    - Set up values, connect to resources, etc.
- Overriding
  - One think to be aware of is that as we are overloading each of these functions, you must call the superclass initialiser within them when you do so

  - ```swift
    override func viewWillAppear(_animated: Bool) {
      super.viewWillAppear(animated)
      // you write your code here
    }
    ```

- Function with `will` run before the event, whereas functions with 'did' run afterwards

## Navigation Hierarchy

### Hierarchical Navigation

- A user makes one choice per screen/scene until they reach their destination scene
  - If they change destination, they have to start from the beginning, retracing their steps back to the start
  - Used in apps such as Settings
- Generally implemented with Navigation Controllers

### Flat Navigation

- Users can switch between different categories or 'workflows'
- Ganerally implemented with a Tab Bar Controller

### Content-Driven Navigation

- This is a different and more free-flow type of navigation
- Users can move in a non-linear fashion between elements of the App
  - The most common example would be games

### Workflows

- It is best to consider what the User will be doing in the App before building it
  - This is to be able to best design the navigation hierarchy
  - Consider the features and how they will be built as View Controllers, as well as the movement between them

### Design Guidelines

- Apple recommend the following things to consider when designing a Navigation Hierarchy
  - Design a structure to make it fast and easy to get to content
  - Use standard navigation controls, such as a Navigation Bar when implementing a Hierarchical Navigation
  - Use a Tab Bar when implementing multiple categories (modes, workflows) of content or functionality
  - Use the correct style (modal va push) where appropriate

## Errors

### "this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key counter"

- This means there was somthing called 'counter' which it can no longer find.
- It's because I changed the label name after connect it from 'counter' to 'counterDisplay'
- Solution:
  1. Click the label on `Main.storyboard`
  2. Control + drag the label to the 'counterDisplay' on `ViewController.swift`
  3. Click "Show the connection inspector" on the Utility Area (the right hand side)
  4. You can see there are two connections on Referencing Outlets
  5. Remove 'counter' from it
